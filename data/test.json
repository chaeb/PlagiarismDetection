        "content1": "This paper proposes an improved emotional voice conversion (EVC) method with emotional strength and duration controllability. EVC methods without duration mapping generate emotional speech with identical duration to that of the neutral input speech. In reality, even the same sentences would have different speeds and rhythms depending on the emotions. To solve this, the proposed method adopts a sequence-to-sequence network with an attention module that enables the network to learn attention in the neutral input sequence should be focused on which part of the emotional output sequence. Besides, to capture the multi-attribute aspects of emotional variations, an emotion encoder is designed for transforming acoustic features into emotion embedding vectors. By aggregating the emotion embedding vectors for each emotion, a representative vector for the target emotion is obtained and weighted to reflect emotion strength. By introducing a speaker encoder, the proposed method can preserve speaker identity even after the emotion conversion. Objective and subjective evaluation results confirm that the proposed method is superior to other previous works. Especially, in emotion strength control, we achieve in getting successful results.",
        "content2": "In this paper, we present a novel technique for a non-parallel voice conversion (VC) with the use of cyclic variational autoencoder (CycleVAE)-based spectral modeling. In a variational autoencoder(VAE) framework, a latent space, usually with a Gaussian prior, is used to encode a set of input features. In a VAE-based VC, the encoded latent features are fed into a decoder, along with speaker-coding features, to generate estimated spectra with either the original speaker identity (reconstructed) or another speaker identity (converted). Due to the non-parallel modeling condition, the converted spectra can not be directly optimized, which heavily degrades the performance of a VAE-based VC. In this work, to overcome this problem, we propose to use CycleVAE-based spectral model that indirectly optimizes the conversion flow by recycling the converted features back into the system to obtain corresponding cyclic reconstructed spectra that can be directly optimized. The cyclic flow can be continued by using the cyclic reconstructed features as input for the next cycle. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CycleVAE-based VC, which yields higher accuracy of converted spectra, generates latent features with higher correlation degree, and significantly improves the quality and conversion accuracy of the converted speech.",

        "content1": "This paper describes a statistically motivated framework for performing real-time dialogue state updates and policy learning in a spoken dialogue system. The framework is based on the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which provides a well-founded, statistical model of spoken dialogue management. However, exact belief state updates in a POMDP model are computationally intractable so approximate methods must be used. This paper presents a tractable method based on the loopy belief propagation algorithm. Various simplifications are made, which improve the efficiency significantly compared to the original algorithm as well as compared to other POMDP-based dialogue state updating approaches. A second contribution of this paper is a method for learning in spoken dialogue systems which uses a component-based policy with the episodic Natural Actor Critic algorithm.\nThe framework proposed in this paper was tested on both simulations and in a user trial. Both indicated that using Bayesian updates of the dialogue state significantly outperforms traditional definitions of the dialogue state. Policy learning worked effectively and the learned policy outperformed all others on simulations. In user trials the learned policy was also competitive, although its optimality was less conclusive. Overall, the Bayesian update of dialogue state framework was shown to be a feasible and effective approach to building real-world POMDP-based dialogue systems.",

        "content1": "Any modification applied to speech signals has an impact on their perceptual quality. In particular, voice conversion to modify a source voice so that it is perceived as a specific target voice involves prosodic and spectral transformations that produce significant quality degradation. Choosing among the current voice conversion methods represents a trade-off between the similarity of the converted voice to the target voice and the quality of the resulting converted speech, both rated by listeners. This paper presents a new voice conversion method termed Weighted Frequency Warping that has a good balance between similarity and quality. This method uses a time-varying piecewise-linear frequency warping function and an energy correction filter, and it combines typical probabilistic techniques and frequency warping transformations. Compared to standard probabilistic systems, Weighted Frequency Warping results in a significant increase in quality scores, whereas the conversion scores remain almost unaltered. This paper carefully discusses the theoretical aspects of the method and the details of its implementation, and the results of an international evaluation of the new system are also included.",

Recent work on Gaussian process reinforcement learning, has shown that learning can be substantially accelerated. This paper reports on an experiment to learn a policy for a real-world task directly from human interaction using rewards provided by users. It shows that a usable policy can be learnt in just a few hundred dialogues without needing a user simulator and, using a learning strategy that reduces the risk of taking bad actions. The paper also investigates adaptation behaviour when the system continues learning for several thousand dialogues and highlights the need for robustness to noisy rewards.",

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) recently emerged as a new paradigm for object representation from multi-view (MV) images. Yet, it cannot handle multi-scale (MS) images and camera pose estimation errors, which generally is the case with multi-view images captured from a day-to-day commodity camera. Although recently proposed Mip-NeRF could handle multi-scale imaging problems with NeRF, it cannot handle camera pose estimation error. On the other hand, the newly proposed BARF can solve the camera pose problem with NeRF but fails if the images are multi-scale in nature. This paper presents a robust multi-scale neural radiance fields representation approach to simultaneously overcome both real-world imaging issues. Our method handles multi-scale imaging effects and camera-pose estimation problems with NeRF-inspired approaches by leveraging the fundamentals of scene rigidity. To reduce unpleasant aliasing artifacts due to multi-scale images in the ray space, we leverage Mip-NeRF multi-scale representation. For joint estimation of robust camera pose, we propose graph-neural network-based multiple motion averaging in the neural volume rendering framework. We demonstrate, with examples, that for an accurate neural representation of an object from day-to-day acquired multi-view images, it is crucial to have precise camera-pose estimates. Without considering robustness measures in the camera pose estimation, modeling for multi-scale aliasing artifacts via conical frustum can be counterproductive. We present extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our approach provides better results than the recent NeRF-inspired approaches for such realistic settings.",

Unfortunately, existing methods such as DVR or IDR require accurate per-pixel object masks as supervision. At the same time, neural radiance fields have revolutionized novel view synthesis. However, NeRF's estimated volume density does not admit accurate surface reconstruction. Our key insight is that implicit surface models and radiance fields can be formulated in a unified way, enabling both surface and volume rendering using the same model. This unified perspective enables novel, more efficient sampling procedures and the ability to reconstruct accurate surfaces without input masks. We compare our method on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and a synthetic indoor dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that we outperform NeRF in terms of reconstruction quality while performing on par with IDR without requiring masks.",

Our solution, which we call \"mip-NeRF\" (a la \"mipmap\"), extends NeRF to represent the scene at a continuously-valued scale. By efficiently rendering anti-aliased conical frustums instead of rays, mip-NeRF reduces objectionable aliasing artifacts and significantly improves NeRF's ability to represent fine details, while also being 7% faster than NeRF and half the size. Compared to NeRF, mip-NeRF reduces average error rates by 17% on the dataset presented with NeRF and by 60% on a challenging multiscale variant of that dataset that we present. Mip-NeRF is also able to match the accuracy of a brute-force supersampled NeRF on our multiscale dataset while being 22x faster.",

Unlike prior works on neural radiance fields that consider per-scene optimization on densely captured images, we propose a generic deep neural network that can reconstruct radiance fields from only three nearby input views via fast network inference. Our approach leverages plane-swept cost volumes (widely used in multi-view stereo) for geometry-aware scene reasoning, and combines this with physically based volume rendering for neural radiance field reconstruction. We train our network on real objects in the DTU dataset, and test it on three different datasets to evaluate its effectiveness and generalizability. Our approach can generalize across scenes (even indoor scenes, completely different from our training scenes of objects) and generate realistic view synthesis results using only three input images, significantly outperforming concurrent works on generalizable radiance field reconstruction. Moreover, if dense images are captured, our estimated radiance field representation can be easily fine-tuned; this leads to fast per-scene reconstruction with higher rendering quality and substantially less optimization time than NeRF.",

The proposed method, called ConvS2S-VC, has three key features. First, it uses a model with a fully convolutional architecture. This is particularly advantageous in that it is suitable for parallel computations using GPUs. It is also beneficial since it enables effective normalization techniques such as batch normalization to be used for all the hidden layers in the networks. Second, it achieves many-to-many conversion by simultaneously learning mappings among multiple speakers using only a single model instead of separately learning mappings between each speaker pair using a different model. This enables the model to fully utilize available training data collected from multiple speakers by capturing common latent features that can be shared across different speakers. Owing to this structure, our model works reasonably well even without source speaker information, thus making it able to handle any-to-many conversion tasks. Third, we introduce a mechanism, called the conditional batch normalization that switches batch normalization layers in accordance with the target speaker. This particular mechanism has been found to be extremely effective for our many-to-many conversion model. We conducted speaker identity conversion experiments and found that ConvS2S-VC obtained higher sound quality and speaker similarity than baseline methods. We also found from audio examples that it could perform well in various tasks including emotional expression conversion, electrolaryngeal speech enhancement, and English accent conversion.",

Using a style encoder, our framework can also convert plain reading speech into stylistic speech, such as emotional and falsetto speech. Subjective and objective evaluation experiments on a non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion task revealed that our model produces natural sounding voices, close to the sound quality of state-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) based voice conversion methods without the need for text labels.

Popular methods for learning task-oriented dialogues include applying reinforcement learning with user feedback on supervised pre-training models. Efficiency of such learning method may suffer from the mismatch of dialogue state distribution between offline training and online interactive learning stages. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid imitation and reinforcement learning method, with which a dialogue agent can effectively learn from its interaction with users by learning from human teaching and feedback. We design a neural network based task-oriented dialogue agent that can be optimized end-to-end with the proposed learning method. Experimental results show that our end-to-end dialogue agent can learn effectively from the mistake it makes via imitation learning from user teaching. Applying reinforcement learning with user feedback after the imitation learning stage further improves the agent's capability in successfully completing a task.",

They offer flexibility, can be easily adapted to new domains, and require minimal domain engineering. A common criticism of these systems is that they seldom understand or use the available dialog history effectively. In this paper, we take an empirical approach to understanding how these models use the available dialog history by studying the sensitivity of the models to artificially introduced unnatural changes or perturbations to their context at test time. We experiment with 10 different types of perturbations on 4 multi-turn dialog datasets and find that commonly used neural dialog architectures like recurrent and transformer-based seq2seq models are rarely sensitive to most perturbations such as missing or reordering utterances, shuffling words, etc. Also, by open-sourcing our code, we believe that it will serve as a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating dialog systems in the future.",

        "content1": "Tremendous progress in deep generative models has led to photorealistic image synthesis. While achieving compelling results, most approaches operate in the two-dimensional image domain, ignoring the three-dimensional nature of our world. Several recent works therefore propose generative models which are 3D-aware, i.e., scenes are modeled in 3D and then rendered differentiably to the image plane. While this leads to impressive 3D consistency, the camera needs to be modelled as well and we show in this work that these methods are sensitive to the choice of prior camera distributions. Current approaches assume fixed intrinsics and predefined priors over camera pose ranges, and parameter tuning is typically required for real-world data. If the data distribution is not matched, results degrade significantly. Our key hypothesis is that learning a camera generator jointly with the image generator leads to a more principled approach to 3D-aware image synthesis. Further, we propose to decompose the scene into a background and foreground model, leading to more efficient and disentangled scene representations. While training from raw, unposed image collections, we learn a 3D- and camera-aware generative model which faithfully recovers not only the image but also the camera data distribution. At test time, our model generates images with explicit control over the camera as well as the shape and appearance of the scene.",

So far, most of the voice conversion studies mainly focus only on the speech voice conversion that is different from singing voice conversion. We note that singing conveys both lexical and emotional information through words and tones. It is one of the most expressive components in music and a means of entertainment as well as self expression. In this paper, we propose a novel singing voice conversion framework, that is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The proposed GAN-based conversion framework, that we call SINGAN, consists of two neural networks: a discriminator to distinguish natural and converted singing voice, and a generator to deceive the discriminator. With GAN, we minimize the differences of the distributions between the original target parameters and the generated singing parameters. To our best knowledge, this is the first framework that uses generative adversarial networks for singing voice conversion. In experiments, we show that the proposed method effectively converts singing voices and outperforms the baseline approach.",

The first challenge in this task is the complex object motions in human-object interactions, which we tackle by introducing the new object bones into the conventional human skeleton hierarchy to effectively estimate large object deformations in our dynamic human-object model. The second challenge is that humans interact with different objects at different times, for which we introduce two new learnable object state embeddings that can be used as conditions for learning our human-object representation and scene representation, respectively.

The alignment of phonetically equivalent source and target vectors is not problematic when the training corpus is parallel, which means that both speakers utter the same training sentences. However, in some practical situations, such as cross-lingual voice conversion, it is not possible to obtain such parallel utterances. With an aim towards increasing the versatility of current voice conversion systems, this paper proposes a new iterative alignment method that allows pairing phonetically equivalent acoustic vectors from nonparallel utterances from different speakers, even under cross-lingual conditions. This method is based on existing voice conversion techniques, and it does not require any phonetic or linguistic information. Subjective evaluation experiments show that the performance of the resulting voice conversion system is very similar to that of an equivalent system trained on a parallel corpus.",

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have attracted significant attention due to their ability to synthesize novel scene views with great accuracy. However, inherent to their underlying formulation, the sampling of points along a ray with zero width may result in ambiguous representations that lead to further rendering artifacts such as aliasing in the final scene. To address this issue, the recent variant mip-NeRF proposes an Integrated Positional Encoding (IPE) based on a conical view frustum. Although this is expressed with an integral formulation, mip-NeRF instead approximates this integral as the expected value of a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This approximation is reliable for short frustums but degrades with highly elongated regions, which arises when dealing with distant scene objects under a larger depth of field. In this paper, we explore the use of an exact approach for calculating the IPE by using a pyramid-based integral formulation instead of an approximated conical-based one. We denote this formulation as Exact-NeRF and contribute the first approach to offer a precise analytical solution to the IPE within the NeRF domain. Our exploratory work illustrates that such an exact formulation (Exact-NeRF) matches the accuracy of mip-NeRF and furthermore provides a natural extension to more challenging scenarios without further modification, such as in the case of unbounded scenes. Our contribution aims to both address the hitherto unexplored issues of frustum approximation in earlier NeRF work and additionally provide insight into the potential future consideration of analytical solutions in future NeRF extensions.",

In this paper, we propose a procedure to train multi-domain, Recurrent Neural Network-based (RNN) language generators via multiple adaptation steps. In this procedure, a model is first trained on counterfeited data synthesised from an out-of-domain dataset, and then fine tuned on a small set of in-domain utterances with a discriminative objective function. Corpus-based evaluation results show that the proposed procedure can achieve competitive performance in terms of BLEU score and slot error rate while significantly reducing the data needed to train generators in new, unseen domains. In subjective testing, human judges confirm that the procedure greatly improves generator performance when only a small amount of data is available in the domain.",

EVC methods without duration mapping generate emotional speech with identical duration to that of the neutral input speech. In reality, even the same sentences would have different speeds and rhythms depending on the emotions. To solve this, the proposed method adopts a sequence-to-sequence network with an attention module that enables the network to learn attention in the neutral input sequence should be focused on which part of the emotional output sequence. Besides, to capture the multi-attribute aspects of emotional variations, an emotion encoder is designed for transforming acoustic features into emotion embedding vectors. By aggregating the emotion embedding vectors for each emotion, a representative vector for the target emotion is obtained and weighted to reflect emotion strength. By introducing a speaker encoder, the proposed method can preserve speaker identity even after the emotion conversion. Objective and subjective evaluation results confirm that the proposed method is superior to other previous works. Especially, in emotion strength control, we achieve in getting successful results.",

Forty-eight users booked appointments using nine different dialogue systems, which varied in the number of options presented and the confirmation strategy used. Participants also performed four cognitive tests and rated the usability of each dialogue system on a standardised questionnaire. When systems presented more options per turn and avoided explicit confirmation subdialogues, both older and younger users booked appointments more quickly without compromising task success. Users with lower information processing speed were less likely to remember all relevant aspects of the appointment. Working memory span did not affect appointment recall. Older users were slightly less satisfied with the dialogue systems than younger users.

Yet, generating these images is very computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a technique based on spatial decomposition capable of mitigating this issue. Our key observation is that there are diminishing returns in employing larger (deeper and/or wider) networks. Hence, we propose to spatially decompose a scene and dedicate smaller networks for each decomposed part. When working together, these networks can render the whole scene. This allows us near-constant inference time regardless of the number of decomposed parts. Moreover, we show that a Voronoi spatial decomposition is preferable for this purpose, as it is provably compatible with the Painter's Algorithm for efficient and GPU-friendly rendering. Our experiments show that for real-world scenes, our method provides up to 3x more efficient inference than NeRF (with the same rendering quality), or an improvement of up to 1.0 dB in PSNR (for the same inference cost).",

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has shown impressive performance in novel view synthesis via implicit scene representation. However, it usually suffers from poor scalability as requiring densely sampled images for each new scene. Several studies have attempted to mitigate this problem by integrating Multi-View Stereo (MVS) technique into NeRF while they still entail a cumbersome fine-tuning process for new scenes. Notably, the rendering quality will drop severely without this fine-tuning process and the errors mainly appear around the high-frequency features. In the light of this observation, we design WaveNeRF, which integrates wavelet frequency decomposition into MVS and NeRF to achieve generalizable yet high-quality synthesis without any per-scene optimization. To preserve high-frequency information when generating 3D feature volumes, WaveNeRF builds Multi-View Stereo in the Wavelet domain by integrating the discrete wavelet transform into the classical cascade MVS, which disentangles high-frequency information explicitly. With that, disentangled frequency features can be injected into classic NeRF via a novel hybrid neural renderer to yield faithful high-frequency details, and an intuitive frequency-guided sampling strategy can be designed to suppress artifacts around high-frequency regions. Extensive experiments over three widely studied benchmarks show that WaveNeRF achieves superior generalizable radiance field modeling when only given three images as input.",

The learnt dialogue behaviours used the Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) model, and we report the first evaluation of this model in a realistic conversational environment. Experimental results in the travel planning domain provide evidence to support the following claims: (a) hierarchical semi-learnt dialogue agents are a better alternative (with higher overall performance) than deterministic or fully-learnt behaviour; (b) spoken dialogue strategies learnt with highly coherent user behaviour and conservative recognition error rates (keyword error rate of 20%) can outperform a reasonable hand-coded strategy; and (c) hierarchical reinforcement learning dialogue agents are feasible and promising for the (semi) automatic design of optimized dialogue behaviours in larger-scale systems.",

We experiment with 10 different types of perturbations on 4 multi-turn dialog datasets and find that commonly used neural dialog architectures like recurrent and transformer-based seq2seq models are rarely sensitive to most perturbations such as missing or reordering utterances, shuffling words, etc. Also, by open-sourcing our code, we believe that it will serve as a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating dialog systems in the future.",

In this paper, we proposed a novel one-shot VC approach which is able to perform VC by only an example utterance from source and target speaker respectively, and the source and target speaker do not even need to be seen during training.

To overcome these limitations, we propose FENeRF, a 3D-aware generator that can produce view-consistent and locally-editable portrait images. Our method uses two decoupled latent codes to generate corresponding facial semantics and texture in a spatial-aligned 3D volume with shared geometry. Benefiting from such underlying 3D representation, FENeRF can jointly render the boundary-aligned image and semantic mask and use the semantic mask to edit the 3D volume via GAN inversion. We further show such 3D representation can be learned from widely available monocular image and semantic mask pairs. Moreover, we reveal that joint learning semantics and texture helps to generate finer geometry. Our experiments demonstrate that FENeRF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various face editing tasks.",

        "content1": "This article proposes a voice conversion (VC) method using sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq or S2S) learning, which flexibly converts not only the voice characteristics but also the pitch contour and duration of input speech. The proposed method, called ConvS2S-VC, has three key features. First, it uses a model with a fully convolutional architecture. This is particularly advantageous in that it is suitable for parallel computations using GPUs. It is also beneficial since it enables effective normalization techniques such as batch normalization to be used for all the hidden layers in the networks. Second, it achieves many-to-many conversion by simultaneously learning mappings among multiple speakers using only a single model instead of separately learning mappings between each speaker pair using a different model. This enables the model to fully utilize available training data collected from multiple speakers by capturing common latent features that can be shared across different speakers. Owing to this structure, our model works reasonably well even without source speaker information, thus making it able to handle any-to-many conversion tasks. Third, we introduce a mechanism, called the conditional batch normalization that switches batch normalization layers in accordance with the target speaker. This particular mechanism has been found to be extremely effective for our many-to-many conversion model. We conducted speaker identity conversion experiments and found that ConvS2S-VC obtained higher sound quality and speaker similarity than baseline methods. We also found from audio examples that it could perform well in various tasks including emotional expression conversion, electrolaryngeal speech enhancement, and English accent conversion.",

To address these issues, we propose NeRF-MS, a novel approach to training NeRF with multi-sequence data. Specifically, we utilize a triplet loss to regularize the distribution of per-image appearance code, which leads to better high-frequency texture and consistent appearance, such as specular reflections. Then, we explicitly model non-static objects to reduce floaters. Extensive results demonstrate that NeRF-MS not only outperforms state-of-the-art view synthesis methods on outdoor and synthetic scenes, but also achieves 3D consistent rendering and robust appearance controlling.

Seq2seq VC models are attractive owing to their ability to convert prosody. While seq2seq models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to VC, the use of the Transformer network, which has shown promising results in various speech processing tasks, has not yet been investigated. Nonetheless, their data-hungry property and the mispronunciation of converted speech make seq2seq models far from practical. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective pretraining technique to transfer knowledge from learned TTS models, which benefit from large-scale, easily accessible TTS corpora. VC models initialized with such pretrained model parameters are able to generate effective hidden representations for high-fidelity, highly intelligible converted speech. Experimental results show that such a pretraining scheme can facilitate data-efficient training and outperform an RNN-based seq2seq VC model in terms of intelligibility, naturalness, and similarity.",

While traditional pipelines struggle with objects like these, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have recently been shown to be remarkably effective for performing view synthesis on objects with thin structures or reflective materials. In this paper we explore the use of NeRF as a new source of supervision for robust robot vision systems. In particular, we demonstrate that a NeRF representation of a scene can be used to train dense object descriptors. We use an optimized NeRF to extract dense correspondences between multiple views of an object, and then use these correspondences as training data for learning a view-invariant representation of the object. NeRF's usage of a density field allows us to reformulate the correspondence problem with a novel distribution-of-depths formulation, as opposed to the conventional approach of using a depth map. Dense correspondence models supervised with our method significantly outperform off-the-shelf learned descriptors by 106% (PCK@3px metric, more than doubling performance) and outperform our baseline supervised with multi-view stereo by 29%. Furthermore, we demonstrate the learned dense descriptors enable robots to perform accurate 6-degree of freedom (6-DoF) pick and place of thin and reflective objects.",

        "content1": "Differences in speaker characteristics, recording conditions, and signal processing algorithms affect output quality in voice conversion systems. This study focuses on formulating robust techniques for a codebook mapping based voice conversion algorithm. Three different methods are used to improve voice conversion performance: confidence measures, pre-emphasis, and spectral equalization. Analysis is performed for each method and the implementation details are discussed. The first method employs confidence measures in the training stage to eliminate problematic pairs of source and target speech units that might result from possible misalignments, speaking style differences or pronunciation variations. Four confidence measures are developed based on the spectral distance, fundamental frequency (f0) distance, energy distance, and duration distance between the source and target speech units. The second method focuses on the importance of pre-emphasis in line-spectral frequency (LSF) based vocal tract modeling and transformation. The last method, spectral equalization, is aimed at reducing the differences in the source and target long-term spectra when the source and target recording conditions are significantly different. The voice conversion algorithm that employs the proposed techniques is compared with the baseline voice conversion algorithm with objective tests as well as three subjective listening tests. First, similarity to the target voice is evaluated in a subjective listening test and it is shown that the proposed algorithm improves similarity to the target voice by 23.0%. An ABX test is performed and the proposed algorithm is preferred over the baseline algorithm by 76.4%. In the third test, the two algorithms are compared in terms of the subjective quality of the voice conversion output. The proposed algorithm improves the subjective output quality by 46.8% in terms of mean opinion score (MOS).",

Our work suitably exploits the image formation model in a MVPS experimental setup to recover the dense 3D reconstruction of an object from images. We procure the surface orientation using a photometric stereo (PS) image formation model and blend it with a multi-view neural radiance field representation to recover the object's surface geometry. Contrary to the previous multi-staged framework to MVPS, where the position, iso-depth contours, or orientation measurements are estimated independently and then fused later, our method is simple to implement and realize. Our method performs neural rendering of multi-view images while utilizing surface normals estimated by a deep photometric stereo network. We render the MVPS images by considering the object's surface normals for each 3D sample point along the viewing direction rather than explicitly using the density gradient in the volume space via 3D occupancy information. We optimize the proposed neural radiance field representation for the MVPS setup efficiently using a fully connected deep network to recover the 3D geometry of an object. Extensive evaluation on the DiLiGenT-MV benchmark dataset shows that our method performs better than the approaches that perform only PS or only multi-view stereo (MVS) and provides comparable results against the state-of-the-art multi-stage fusion methods.",

Notably, the rendering quality will drop severely without this fine-tuning process and the errors mainly appear around the high-frequency features. In the light of this observation, we design WaveNeRF, which integrates wavelet frequency decomposition into MVS and NeRF to achieve generalizable yet high-quality synthesis without any per-scene optimization. To preserve high-frequency information when generating 3D feature volumes, WaveNeRF builds Multi-View Stereo in the Wavelet domain by integrating the discrete wavelet transform into the classical cascade MVS, which disentangles high-frequency information explicitly. With that, disentangled frequency features can be injected into classic NeRF via a novel hybrid neural renderer to yield faithful high-frequency details, and an intuitive frequency-guided sampling strategy can be designed to suppress artifacts around high-frequency regions. Extensive experiments over three widely studied benchmarks show that WaveNeRF achieves superior generalizable radiance field modeling when only given three images as input.",

Modern dialogue systems may consider adopting anthropomorphic personas, mimicking societal demographic groups to appear more approachable and trustworthy to users. However, the adoption of a persona can result in the adoption of biases. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study on persona biases in dialogue systems and conduct analyses on personas of different social classes, sexual orientations, races, and genders. We define persona biases as harmful differences in responses (e.g., varying levels of offensiveness, agreement with harmful statements) generated from adopting different demographic personas. Furthermore, we introduce an open-source framework, UnitPersonaBias, to explore and aggregate persona biases in dialogue systems. By analyzing the Blender and DialoGPT dialogue systems, we observe that adopting personas can actually decrease harmful responses, compared to not using any personas. Additionally, we find that persona choices can affect the degree of harms in generated responses and thus should be systematically evaluated before deployment. We also analyze how personas can result in different amounts of harm towards specific demographics.",

        "content1": "We introduce a novel sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) voice conversion (VC) model based on the Transformer architecture with text-to-speech (TTS) pretraining. Seq2seq VC models are attractive owing to their ability to convert prosody. While seq2seq models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to VC, the use of the Transformer network, which has shown promising results in various speech processing tasks, has not yet been investigated. Nonetheless, their data-hungry property and the mispronunciation of converted speech make seq2seq models far from practical. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective pretraining technique to transfer knowledge from learned TTS models, which benefit from large-scale, easily accessible TTS corpora. VC models initialized with such pretrained model parameters are able to generate effective hidden representations for high-fidelity, highly intelligible converted speech. Experimental results show that such a pretraining scheme can facilitate data-efficient training and outperform an RNN-based seq2seq VC model in terms of intelligibility, naturalness, and similarity.",
        "content2": "Asynchronously operating event cameras find many applications due to their high dynamic range, vanishingly low motion blur, low latency and low data bandwidth. The field saw remarkable progress during the last few years, and existing event-based 3D reconstruction approaches recover sparse point clouds of the scene. However, such sparsity is a limiting factor in many cases, especially in computer vision and graphics, that has not been addressed satisfactorily so far. Accordingly, this paper proposes the first approach for 3D-consistent, dense and photorealistic novel view synthesis using just a single colour event stream as input. At its core is a neural radiance field trained entirely in a self-supervised manner from events while preserving the original resolution of the colour event channels. Next, our ray sampling strategy is tailored to events and allows for data-efficient training. At test, our method produces results in the RGB space at unprecedented quality. We evaluate our method qualitatively and numerically on several challenging synthetic and real scenes and show that it produces significantly denser and more visually appealing renderings than the existing methods. We also demonstrate robustness in challenging scenarios with fast motion and under low lighting conditions.

        "content1": "Purely MLP-based neural radiance fields (NeRF-based methods) often suffer from underfitting with blurred renderings on large-scale scenes due to limited model capacity. Recent approaches propose to geographically divide the scene and adopt multiple sub-NeRFs to model each region individually, leading to linear scale-up in training costs and the number of sub-NeRFs as the scene expands. An alternative solution is to use a feature grid representation, which is computationally efficient and can naturally scale to a large scene with increased grid resolutions. However, the feature grid tends to be less constrained and often reaches suboptimal solutions, producing noisy artifacts in renderings, especially in regions with complex geometry and texture. In this work, we present a new framework that realizes high-fidelity rendering on large urban scenes while being computationally efficient. We propose to use a compact multi-resolution ground feature plane representation to coarsely capture the scene, and complement it with positional encoding inputs through another NeRF branch for rendering in a joint learning fashion. We show that such an integration can utilize the advantages of two alternative solutions: a light-weighted NeRF is sufficient, under the guidance of the feature grid representation, to render photorealistic novel views with fine details; and the jointly optimized ground feature planes, can meanwhile gain further refinements, forming a more accurate and compact feature space and output much more natural rendering results.",

The proposed method is general purpose, high quality, and parallel-data free and works without any extra data, modules, or alignment procedure. It also avoids over-smoothing, which occurs in many conventional statistical model-based VC methods. Our method, called CycleGAN-VC, uses a cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) with gated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and an identity-mapping loss. A CycleGAN learns forward and inverse mappings simultaneously using adversarial and cycle-consistency losses. This makes it possible to find an optimal pseudo pair from unpaired data. Furthermore, the adversarial loss contributes to reducing over-smoothing of the converted feature sequence. We configure a CycleGAN with gated CNNs and train it with an identity-mapping loss. This allows the mapping function to capture sequential and hierarchical structures while preserving linguistic information. We evaluated our method on a parallel-data-free VC task. An objective evaluation showed that the converted feature sequence was near natural in terms of global variance and modulation spectra. A subjective evaluation showed that the quality of the converted speech was comparable to that obtained with a Gaussian mixture model-based method under advantageous conditions with parallel and twice the amount of data.",

In this work, we develop a novel method to model the deformable neural radiance fields using RGB and Event cameras. The proposed method uses the asynchronous stream of events and calibrated sparse RGB frames. In this setup, the pose of the individual events --required to integrate them into the radiance fields-- remains to be unknown. Our method jointly optimizes the pose and the radiance field, in an efficient manner by leveraging the collection of events at once and actively sampling the events during learning. Experiments conducted on both realistically rendered and real-world datasets demonstrate a significant benefit of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art and the compared baseline. This shows a promising direction for modeling deformable neural radiance fields in real-world dynamic scenes. Our code and data will be publicly available.",

        "content1": "In this paper, we present a novel technique for a non-parallel voice conversion (VC) with the use of cyclic variational autoencoder (CycleVAE)-based spectral modeling. In a variational autoencoder(VAE) framework, a latent space, usually with a Gaussian prior, is used to encode a set of input features. In a VAE-based VC, the encoded latent features are fed into a decoder, along with speaker-coding features, to generate estimated spectra with either the original speaker identity (reconstructed) or another speaker identity (converted). Due to the non-parallel modeling condition, the converted spectra can not be directly optimized, which heavily degrades the performance of a VAE-based VC. In this work, to overcome this problem, we propose to use CycleVAE-based spectral model that indirectly optimizes the conversion flow by recycling the converted features back into the system to obtain corresponding cyclic reconstructed spectra that can be directly optimized. The cyclic flow can be continued by using the cyclic reconstructed features as input for the next cycle. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CycleVAE-based VC, which yields higher accuracy of converted spectra, generates latent features with higher correlation degree, and significantly improves the quality and conversion accuracy of the converted speech.",

By querying spatial points and view directions, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) can be trained to output the volume density and radiance at each point, which lets us render novel views of the scene. The original NeRF and its recent variants, however, target opaque scenes dominated by diffuse reflection surfaces and cannot handle complex refractive surfaces well. We introduce NeRFrac to realize neural novel view synthesis of scenes captured through refractive surfaces, typically water surfaces. For each queried ray, an MLP-based Refractive Field is trained to estimate the distance from the ray origin to the refractive surface. A refracted ray at each intersection point is then computed by Snell's Law, given the input ray and the approximated local normal. Points of the scene are sampled along the refracted ray and are sent to a Radiance Field for further radiance estimation. We show that from a sparse set of images, our model achieves accurate novel view synthesis of the scene underneath the refractive surface and simultaneously reconstructs the refractive surface. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method with synthetic and real scenes seen through water surfaces. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of NeRFrac for modeling scenes seen through wavy refractive surfaces.",

        "content1": "Voice conversion methods based on frequency warping followed by amplitude scaling have been recently proposed. These methods modify the frequency axis of the source spectrum in such manner that some significant parts of it, usually the formants, are moved towards their image in the target speaker's spectrum. Amplitude scaling is then applied to compensate for the differences between warped source spectra and target spectra. This article presents a fully parametric formulation of a frequency warping plus amplitude scaling method in which bilinear frequency warping functions are used. Introducing this constraint allows for the conversion error to be described in the cepstral domain and to minimize it with respect to the parameters of the transformation through an iterative algorithm, even when multiple overlapping conversion classes are considered. The paper explores the advantages and limitations of this approach when applied to a cepstral representation of speech. We show that it achieves significant improvements in quality with respect to traditional methods based on Gaussian mixture models, with no loss in average conversion accuracy. Despite its relative simplicity, it achieves similar performance scores to state-of-the-art statistical methods involving dynamic features and global variance.",
        "content2": "This paper proposes a novel approach to voice conversion with non-parallel training data. The idea is to bridge between speakers by means of Phonetic PosteriorGrams (PPGs) obtained from a speaker-independent automatic speech recognition (SI-ASR) system. It is assumed that these PPGs can represent articulation of speech sounds in a speaker-normalized space and correspond to spoken content speaker-independently. The proposed approach first obtains PPGs of target speech. Then, a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Recurrent Neural Network (DBLSTM) structure is used to model the relationships between the PPGs and acoustic features of the target speech. To convert arbitrary source speech, we obtain its PPGs from the same SI-ASR and feed them into the trained DBLSTM for generating converted speech. Our approach has two main advantages: 1) no parallel training data is required; 2) a trained model can be applied to any other source speaker for a fixed target speaker (i.e., many-to-one conversion). Experiments show that our approach performs equally well or better than state-of-the-art systems in both speech quality and speaker similarity.",

Cycle-consistent adversarial network-based VCs (CycleGAN-VC and CycleGAN-VC2) are widely accepted as benchmark methods. However, owing to their insufficient ability to grasp time-frequency structures, their application is limited to mel-cepstrum conversion and not mel-spectrogram conversion despite recent advances in mel-spectrogram vocoders. To overcome this, CycleGAN-VC3, an improved variant of CycleGAN-VC2 that incorporates an additional module called time-frequency adaptive normalization (TFAN), has been proposed. However, an increase in the number of learned parameters is imposed. As an alternative, we propose MaskCycleGAN-VC, which is another extension of CycleGAN-VC2 and is trained using a novel auxiliary task called filling in frames (FIF). With FIF, we apply a temporal mask to the input mel-spectrogram and encourage the converter to fill in missing frames based on surrounding frames. This task allows the converter to learn time-frequency structures in a self-supervised manner and eliminates the need for an additional module such as TFAN. A subjective evaluation of the naturalness and speaker similarity showed that MaskCycleGAN-VC outperformed both CycleGAN-VC2 and CycleGAN-VC3 with a model size similar to that of CycleGAN-VC2.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>",

Our approach extends Neural Radiance Fields, which has been demonstrated to synthesize realistic novel images for small scenes in controlled settings, with new methods for leveraging asynchronously captured lidar data, for addressing exposure variation between captured images, and for leveraging predicted image segmentations to supervise densities on rays pointing at the sky. Each of these three extensions provides significant performance improvements in experiments on Street View data.

To this end, we propose a novel Tri-Mip encoding (a la \"mipmap\") that enables both instant reconstruction and anti-aliased high-fidelity rendering for neural radiance fields. The key is to factorize the pre-filtered 3D feature spaces in three orthogonal mipmaps. In this way, we can efficiently perform 3D area sampling by taking advantage of 2D pre-filtered feature maps, which significantly elevates the rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency. To cope with the novel Tri-Mip representation, we propose a cone-casting rendering technique to efficiently sample anti-aliased 3D features with the Tri-Mip encoding considering both pixel imaging and observing distance. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and reconstruction speed while maintaining a compact representation that reduces 25% model size compared against Instant-ngp.

In the traditional exemplar-based sparse representation approach to voice conversion, a general source-target dictionary of exemplars is constructed to establish the correspondence between source and target speakers. In this work, we propose a Phonetically Aware Sparse Representation of fundamental frequency and energy contour by using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). Our idea is motivated by the facts that CWT decompositions of F0 and energy contours describe prosody patterns in different temporal scales and allow for effective prosody manipulation in speech synthesis. Furthermore, phonetically aware exemplars lead to better estimation of activation matrix, therefore, possibly better conversion of prosody. We also propose a phonetically aware duration conversion framework which takes into account both phone-level and sentence-level speaking rates. We report that the proposed prosody conversion outperforms the traditional prosody conversion techniques in both objective and subjective evaluations.",

GUS (Genial Understander System) is intended to engage a sympathetic and highly cooperative human in an English dialog, directed towards a specific goal within a very restricted domain of discourse. As a starting point, GUS was restricted to the role of a travel agent in a conversation with a client who wants to make a simple return trip to a single city in California.\nThere is good reason for restricting the domain of discourse for a computer system which is to engage in an English dialog. Specializing the subject matter that the system can talk about permits it to achieve some measure of realism without encompassing all the possibilities of human knowledge or of the English language. It also provides the user with specific motivation for participating in the conversation, thus narrowing the range of expectations that GUS must have about the user's purposes. A system restricted in this way will be more able to guide the conversation within the boundaries of its competence.",

        "content1": "Task-oriented dialogue systems are either modularized with separate dialogue state tracking (DST) and management steps or end-to-end trainable. In either case, the knowledge base (KB) plays an essential role in fulfilling user requests. Modularized systems rely on DST to interact with the KB, which is expensive in terms of annotation and inference time. End-to-end systems use the KB directly as input, but they cannot scale when the KB is larger than a few hundred entries. In this paper, we propose a method to embed the KB, of any size, directly into the model parameters. The resulting model does not require any DST or template responses, nor the KB as input, and it can dynamically update its KB via fine-tuning. We evaluate our solution in five task-oriented dialogue datasets with small, medium, and large KB size. Our experiments show that end-to-end models can effectively embed knowledge bases in their parameters and achieve competitive performance in all evaluated datasets.",

Unfortunately, existing methods such as DVR or IDR require accurate per-pixel object masks as supervision. At the same time, neural radiance fields have revolutionized novel view synthesis. However, NeRF's estimated volume density does not admit accurate surface reconstruction. Our key insight is that implicit surface models and radiance fields can be formulated in a unified way, enabling both surface and volume rendering using the same model. This unified perspective enables novel, more efficient sampling procedures and the ability to reconstruct accurate surfaces without input masks. We compare our method on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and a synthetic indoor dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that we outperform NeRF in terms of reconstruction quality while performing on par with IDR without requiring masks.",

Our approach takes RGB images of a dynamic scene as input (e.g., from a monocular video recording), and creates a high-quality space-time geometry and appearance representation. We show that a single handheld consumer-grade camera is sufficient to synthesize sophisticated renderings of a dynamic scene from novel virtual camera views, e.g. a `bullet-time' video effect. NR-NeRF disentangles the dynamic scene into a canonical volume and its deformation. Scene deformation is implemented as ray bending, where straight rays are deformed non-rigidly. We also propose a novel rigidity network to better constrain rigid regions of the scene, leading to more stable results. The ray bending and rigidity network are trained without explicit supervision. Our formulation enables dense correspondence estimation across views and time, and compelling video editing applications such as motion exaggeration. Our code will be open sourced.",

Our DBARF which bundle adjusts camera poses by taking a cost feature map as an implicit cost function can be jointly trained with GeNeRFs in a self-supervised manner. Unlike BARF and its follow-up works, which can only be applied to per-scene optimized NeRFs and need accurate initial camera poses with the exception of forward-facing scenes, our method can generalize across scenes and does not require any good initialization.

        "content1": "Under good conditions, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown impressive results on novel view synthesis tasks. NeRFs learn a scene's color and density fields by minimizing the photometric discrepancy between training views and differentiable renderings of the scene. Once trained from a sufficient set of views, NeRFs can generate novel views from arbitrary camera positions. However, the scene geometry and color fields are severely under-constrained, which can lead to artifacts, especially when trained with few input views. To alleviate this problem we learn a prior over scene geometry and color, using a denoising diffusion model (DDM). Our DDM is trained on RGBD patches of the synthetic Hypersim dataset and can be used to predict the gradient of the logarithm of a joint probability distribution of color and depth patches. We show that, these gradients of logarithms of RGBD patch priors serve to regularize geometry and color of a scene. During NeRF training, random RGBD patches are rendered and the estimated gradient of the log-likelihood is backpropagated to the color and density fields. Evaluations on LLFF, the most relevant dataset, show that our learned prior achieves improved quality in the reconstructed geometry and improved generalization to novel views. Evaluations on DTU show improved reconstruction quality among NeRF methods.",

We first develop a multi-speaker speech synthesis system with sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder extracts the linguistic representations of input text, while the decoder, conditioned on target speaker embedding, takes the context vectors and the attention recurrent network cell output to generate target acoustic features. We take advantage of the fact that TTS system maps input text to speaker independent context vectors, thus re-purpose such a mapping to supervise the training of the latent representations of an encoder-decoder voice conversion system. In the voice conversion system, the encoder takes speech instead of text as the input, while the decoder is functionally similar to the TTS decoder. As we condition the decoder on a speaker embedding, the system can be trained on non-parallel data for any-to-any voice conversion. During voice conversion training, we present both text and speech to speech synthesis and voice conversion networks respectively. At run-time, the voice conversion network uses its own encoder-decoder architecture without the need of text input. Experiments show that the proposed TTL-VC system outperforms two competitive voice conversion baselines consistently, namely phonetic posteriorgram and AutoVC methods, in terms of speech quality, naturalness, and speaker similarity.",

Input with an image sequence from a single camera, our network is trained fully automatically and models topologically varying dynamics using our picked-out surface key points. Then end-users can edit the scene by easily dragging the key points to desired new positions. To achieve this, we propose a scene analysis method to detect and initialize key points by considering the dynamics in the scene, and a weighted key points strategy to model topologically varying dynamics by joint key points and weights optimization. Our method supports intuitive multi-dimensional (up to 3D) editing and can generate novel scenes that are unseen in the input sequence. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality editing on various dynamic scenes and outperforms the state-of-the-art.

        "content1": "In this paper, we address the challenging problem of 3D toonification, which involves transferring the style of an artistic domain onto a target 3D face with stylized geometry and texture. Although fine-tuning a pre-trained 3D GAN on the artistic domain can produce reasonable performance, this strategy has limitations in the 3D domain. In particular, fine-tuning can deteriorate the original GAN latent space, which affects subsequent semantic editing, and requires independent optimization and storage for each new style, limiting flexibility and efficient deployment. To overcome these challenges, we propose DeformToon3D, an effective toonification framework tailored for hierarchical 3D GAN. Our approach decomposes 3D toonification into subproblems of geometry and texture stylization to better preserve the original latent space. Specifically, we devise a novel StyleField that predicts conditional 3D deformation to align a real-space NeRF to the style space for geometry stylization. Thanks to the StyleField formulation, which already handles geometry stylization well, texture stylization can be achieved conveniently via adaptive style mixing that injects information of the artistic domain into the decoder of the pre-trained 3D GAN. Due to the unique design, our method enables flexible style degree control and shape-texture-specific style swap. Furthermore, we achieve efficient training without any real-world 2D-3D training pairs but proxy samples synthesized from off-the-shelf 2D toonification models.",

Moreover, a view-to-view transformer is introduced to fuse multi-view features and learn view-dependent features directly from high-resolution inputs. With the modeling power of DoubleField and the view-to-view transformer, our method significantly improves the reconstruction quality of both geometry and appearance, while supporting direct inference, scene-specific high-resolution finetuning, and fast rendering. The efficacy of DoubleField is validated by the quantitative evaluations on several datasets and the qualitative results in a real-world sparse multi-view system, showing its superior capability for high-quality human model reconstruction and photo-realistic free-viewpoint human rendering. Data and source code will be made public for the research purpose.",
        "content2": "This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing an animatable human model from a multi-view video. Some recent works have proposed to decompose a non-rigidly deforming scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of deformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space, thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field, which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these representations cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we introduce neural blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based on the skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human skeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can regularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend weight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new deformation fields to animate the human model. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent human synthesis methods.

One RTRBM is used for each speaker, with the goal of capturing high-order temporal dependencies in an acoustic sequence. Our algorithm starts from the separate training of one RTRBM for a source speaker and another for a target speaker using speaker-dependent training data. Because each RTRBM attempts to discover abstractions to maximally express the training data at each time step, as well as the temporal dependencies in the training data, we expect that the models represent the linguistic-related latent features in high-order spaces. In our approach, we convert (match) features of emphasis for the source speaker to those of the target speaker using a neural network (NN), so that the entire network (consisting of the two RTRBMs and the NN) acts as a deep recurrent NN and can be fine-tuned. Using VC experiments, we confirm the high performance of our method, especially in terms of objective criteria, relative to conventional VC methods such as approaches based on Gaussian mixture models and on NNs.",

Converted speech is produced by a basic LP analysis of the source and LP synthesis using the converted spectral envelopes. We compared three types of conversion: without mapping, with mapping and using the excitation of the source speaker and finally with mapping using the excitation of the target. Results show that the combination of mapping and frame selection provide the best results, and underline the interest to work on methods to convert the LP excitation.",

        "content1": "The rendering procedure used by neural radiance fields (NeRF) samples a scene with a single ray per pixel and may therefore produce renderings that are excessively blurred or aliased when training or testing images observe scene content at different resolutions. The straightforward solution of supersampling by rendering with multiple rays per pixel is impractical for NeRF, because rendering each ray requires querying a multilayer perceptron hundreds of times. Our solution, which we call \"mip-NeRF\" (a la \"mipmap\"), extends NeRF to represent the scene at a continuously-valued scale. By efficiently rendering anti-aliased conical frustums instead of rays, mip-NeRF reduces objectionable aliasing artifacts and significantly improves NeRF's ability to represent fine details, while also being 7% faster than NeRF and half the size. Compared to NeRF, mip-NeRF reduces average error rates by 17% on the dataset presented with NeRF and by 60% on a challenging multiscale variant of that dataset that we present. Mip-NeRF is also able to match the accuracy of a brute-force supersampled NeRF on our multiscale dataset while being 22x faster.",

In a variational autoencoder(VAE) framework, a latent space, usually with a Gaussian prior, is used to encode a set of input features. In a VAE-based VC, the encoded latent features are fed into a decoder, along with speaker-coding features, to generate estimated spectra with either the original speaker identity (reconstructed) or another speaker identity (converted). Due to the non-parallel modeling condition, the converted spectra can not be directly optimized, which heavily degrades the performance of a VAE-based VC. In this work, to overcome this problem, we propose to use CycleVAE-based spectral model that indirectly optimizes the conversion flow by recycling the converted features back into the system to obtain corresponding cyclic reconstructed spectra that can be directly optimized. The cyclic flow can be continued by using the cyclic reconstructed features as input for the next cycle. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CycleVAE-based VC, which yields higher accuracy of converted spectra, generates latent features with higher correlation degree, and significantly improves the quality and conversion accuracy of the converted speech.",

A comparative study of voice conversion using an ANN model and the state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is conducted. The results of voice conversion, evaluated using subjective and objective measures, confirm that an ANN-based VC system performs as good as that of a GMM-based VC system, and the quality of the transformed speech is intelligible and possesses the characteristics of a target speaker. In this paper, we also address the issue of dependency of voice conversion techniques on parallel data between the source and the target speakers. While there have been efforts to use nonparallel data and speaker adaptation techniques, it is important to investigate techniques which capture speaker-specific characteristics of a target speaker, and avoid any need for source speaker's data either for training or for adaptation. In this paper, we propose a voice conversion approach using an ANN model to capture speaker-specific characteristics of a target speaker and demonstrate that such a voice conversion approach can perform monolingual as well as cross-lingual voice conversion of an arbitrary source speaker.",

The latter can be evaluated from various points of view, such as recognition and understanding rates, dialogue naturalness and robustness against recognition errors. Evaluation usually requires compiling a large corpus of words and sentences uttered by users, relevant to the application domain the system is designed for. This paper proposes a new technique that makes it possible to reuse such a corpus for the evaluation and to check the performance of the system when different dialogue strategies are used. The technique is based on the automatic generation of conversations between the dialogue system, together with an additional dialogue system called user simulator that represents the user’s interaction with the dialogue system. The technique has been applied to evaluate a dialogue system developed in our lab using two different recognition front-ends and two different dialogue strategies to handle user confirmations. The experiments show that the prompt-dependent recognition front-end achieves better results, but that this front-end is appropriate only if users limit their utterances to those related to the current system prompt. The prompt-independent front-end achieves inferior results, but enables front-end users to utter any permitted utterance at any time, irrespective of the system prompt. In consequence, this front-end may allow a more natural and comfortable interaction. The experiments also show that the re-prompting confirmation strategy enhances system performance for both recognition front-ends.",

However, F0 can robustly represent various prosody signals (e.g., emotional prosody). In this study, we propose an effective method based on the NNs to train the normalized-segment-F0 features (NSF0) for emotional prosody conversion. Meanwhile, the proposed method adopts deep belief networks (DBNs) to train spectrum features for voice conversion. By using these approaches, the proposed method can change the spectrum and the prosody for the emotional voice at the same time. Moreover, the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for voice emotional conversion.",

We evaluate naturalness and speaker similarity of the converted whisper on an internal corpus and on the publicly available wTIMIT corpus. We show that applying VC techniques is significantly better than using rule-based signal processing methods and it achieves results that are indistinguishable from copy-synthesis of natural whisper recordings. We investigate the ability of the DNN model to generalize on unseen speakers, when trained with data from multiple speakers. We show that excluding the target speaker from the training set has little or no impact on the perceived naturalness and speaker similarity of the converted whisper.

Currently, standard VC approaches use Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based transformations that do not generate high-quality converted speech due to “over-smoothing” resulting from weak links between individual source and target frame parameters. Dynamic Frequency Warping (DFW) offers an appealing alternative to GMM-based methods, as more spectral details are maintained in transformation; however, the speaker timbre is less successfully converted because spectral power is not adjusted explicitly. Previous work combines separate GMM- and DFW-transformed spectral envelopes for each frame. This paper proposes a more effective DFW-based approach that (1) does not rely on the baseline GMM methods, and (2) functions on the acoustic class level. To adjust spectral power, an amplitude scaling function is used that compares the average target and warped source log spectra for each acoustic class. The proposed DFW with Amplitude scaling (DFWA) outperforms standard GMM and hybrid GMM-DFW methods for VC in terms of both speech quality and timbre conversion, as is confirmed in extensive objective and subjective testing.

In this work we study various model architectures and different ways to represent and aggregate the source information in an end-to-end neural dialogue system framework. A method called snapshot learning is also proposed to facilitate learning from supervised sequential signals by applying a companion cross-entropy objective function to the conditioning vector. The experimental and analytical results demonstrate firstly that competition occurs between the conditioning vector and the LM, and the differing architectures provide different trade-offs between the two. Secondly, the discriminative power and transparency of the conditioning vector is key to providing both model interpretability and better performance. Thirdly, snapshot learning leads to consistent performance improvements independent of which architecture is used.",

Digitally modeling and reconstructing a talking human is a key building-block for a variety of applications. Especially, for telepresence applications in AR or VR, a faithful reproduction of the appearance including novel viewpoint or head-poses is required. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches that model the geometry and material properties explicitly, or are purely image-based, we introduce an implicit representation of the head based on scene representation networks. To handle the dynamics of the face, we combine our scene representation network with a low-dimensional morphable model which provides explicit control over pose and expressions. We use volumetric rendering to generate images from this hybrid representation and demonstrate that such a dynamic neural scene representation can be learned from monocular input data only, without the need of a specialized capture setup. In our experiments, we show that this learned volumetric representation allows for photorealistic image generation that surpasses the quality of state-of-the-art video-based reenactment methods.",

At training stage, a SCENT model is estimated by aligning the feature sequences of source and target speakers implicitly using attention mechanism. At the conversion stage, acoustic features and durations of source utterances are converted simultaneously using the unified acoustic model. Mel-scale spectrograms are adopted as acoustic features, which contain both excitation and vocal tract descriptions of speech signals. The bottleneck features extracted from source speech using an automatic speech recognition model are appended as an auxiliary input. A WaveNet vocoder conditioned on Mel-spectrograms is built to reconstruct waveforms from the outputs of the SCENT model. It is worth noting that our proposed method can achieve appropriate duration conversion, which is difficult in conventional methods. Experimental results show that our proposed method obtained better objective and subjective performance than the baseline methods using Gaussian mixture models and deep neural networks as acoustic models. This proposed method also outperformed our previous work, which achieved the top rank in Voice Conversion Challenge 2018.

Given a sequence of posed RGB images and lidar sweeps acquired by cameras and scanners moving through an outdoor scene, we produce a model from which 3D surfaces can be extracted and novel RGB images can be synthesized. Our approach extends Neural Radiance Fields, which has been demonstrated to synthesize realistic novel images for small scenes in controlled settings, with new methods for leveraging asynchronously captured lidar data, for addressing exposure variation between captured images, and for leveraging predicted image segmentations to supervise densities on rays pointing at the sky. Each of these three extensions provides significant performance improvements in experiments on Street View data. Our system produces state-of-the-art 3D surface reconstructions and synthesizes higher quality novel views in comparison to both traditional methods (e.g. COLMAP) and recent neural representations (e.g. Mip-NeRF).",

In this work, we investigate whether we can apply analysis-by-synthesis via NeRF for mesh-free, RGB-only 6DoF pose estimation – given an image, find the translation and rotation of a camera relative to a 3D object or scene. Our method assumes that no object mesh models are available during either training or test time. Starting from an initial pose estimate, we use gradient descent to minimize the residual between pixels rendered from a NeRF and pixels in an observed image. In our experiments, we first study 1) how to sample rays during pose refinement for iNeRF to collect informative gradients and 2) how different batch sizes of rays affect iNeRF on a synthetic dataset. We then show that for complex real-world scenes from the LLFF dataset [21], iNeRF can improve NeRF by estimating the camera poses of novel images and using these images as additional training data for NeRF. Finally, we show iNeRF can perform categorylevel object pose estimation, including object instances not seen during training, with RGB images by inverting a NeRF model inferred from a single view.",

Modularized systems rely on DST to interact with the KB, which is expensive in terms of annotation and inference time. End-to-end systems use the KB directly as input, but they cannot scale when the KB is larger than a few hundred entries. In this paper, we propose a method to embed the KB, of any size, directly into the model parameters. The resulting model does not require any DST or template responses, nor the KB as input, and it can dynamically update its KB via fine-tuning. We evaluate our solution in five task-oriented dialogue datasets with small, medium, and large KB size.

To prevent overfitting, the degrees of freedom in the mapping can be controlled by choosing a suitable number of components. We propose a technique to combine PLS with GMMs, enabling the use of multiple local linear mappings. To further improve the perceptual quality of the mapping where rapid transitions between GMM components produce audible artefacts, we propose to low-pass filter the component posterior probabilities. The conducted experiments show that the proposed technique results in better subjective and objective quality than the baseline joint density GMM approach. In speech quality conversion preference tests, the proposed method achieved 67% preference score against the smoothed joint density GMM method and 84% preference score against the unsmoothed joint density GMM method.

        "content1": "The objective of voice conversion system is to formulate the mapping function which can transform the source speaker characteristics to that of the target speaker. In this paper, we propose the General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) based model for voice conversion. It is a single pass learning network that makes the training procedure fast and comparatively less time consuming. The proposed system uses the shape of the vocal tract, the shape of the glottal pulse (excitation signal) and long term prosodic features to carry out the voice conversion task. In this paper, the shape of the vocal tract and the shape of source excitation of a particular speaker are represented using Line Spectral Frequencies (LSFs) and Linear Prediction (LP) residual respectively. GRNN is used to obtain the mapping function between the source and target speakers. The direct transformation of the time domain residual using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) causes phase change and generates artifacts in consecutive frames. In order to alleviate it, wavelet packet decomposed coefficients are used to characterize the excitation of the speech signal. The long term prosodic parameters namely, pitch contour (intonation) and the energy profile of the test signal are also modified in relation to that of the target (desired) speaker using the baseline method. The relative performances of the proposed model are compared to voice conversion system based on the state of the art RBF and GMM models using objective and subjective evaluation measures. The evaluation measures show that the proposed GRNN based voice conversion system performs slightly better than the state of the art models.",

In this paper, we define the Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) task and propose an ESC Framework, which is grounded on the Helping Skills Theory. We construct an Emotion Support Conversation dataset (ESConv) with rich annotation (especially support strategy) in a help-seeker and supporter mode. To ensure a corpus of high-quality conversations that provide examples of effective emotional support, we take extensive effort to design training tutorials for supporters and several mechanisms for quality control during data collection.

Subsequently, our DReg-NeRF utilizes a transformer architecture with self-attention and cross-attention layers to learn the relations between pairwise NeRF blocks.

The idea is to bridge between speakers by means of Phonetic PosteriorGrams (PPGs) obtained from a speaker-independent automatic speech recognition (SI-ASR) system. It is assumed that these PPGs can represent articulation of speech sounds in a speaker-normalized space and correspond to spoken content speaker-independently. The proposed approach first obtains PPGs of target speech. Then, a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Recurrent Neural Network (DBLSTM) structure is used to model the relationships between the PPGs and acoustic features of the target speech. To convert arbitrary source speech, we obtain its PPGs from the same SI-ASR and feed them into the trained DBLSTM for generating converted speech. Our approach has two main advantages: 1) no parallel training data is required; 2) a trained model can be applied to any other source speaker for a fixed target speaker (i.e., many-to-one conversion). Experiments show that our approach performs equally well or better than state-of-the-art systems in both speech quality and speaker similarity.",

Specifically, to improve the accuracy of dynamic head reconstruction, a compact and expressive NeRF-based Tri-Plane Hash Representation is introduced by pruning empty spatial regions with three planar hash encoders. For speech audio, we propose a Region Attention Module to generate region-aware condition feature via an attention mechanism. Different from existing methods that utilize an MLP-based encoder to learn the cross-modal relation implicitly, the attention mechanism builds an explicit connection between audio features and spatial regions to capture the priors of local motions. Moreover, a direct and fast Adaptive Pose Encoding is introduced to optimize the head-torso separation problem by mapping the complex transformation of the head pose into spatial coordinates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method renders better high-fidelity and audio-lips synchronized talking portrait videos, with realistic details and high efficiency compared to previous methods.",

Moral deviations are difficult to mitigate because moral judgments are not universal, and there may be multiple competing judgments that apply to a situation simultaneously. In this work, we introduce a new resource, not to authoritatively resolve moral ambiguities, but instead to facilitate systematic understanding of the intuitions, values and moral judgments reflected in the utterances of dialogue systems. The Moral Integrity Corpus, MIC, is such a resource, which captures the moral assumptions of 38k prompt-reply pairs, using 99k distinct Rules of Thumb (RoTs). Each RoT reflects a particular moral conviction that can explain why a chatbot's reply may appear acceptable or problematic. We further organize RoTs with a set of 9 moral and social attributes and benchmark performance for attribute classification. Most importantly, we show that current neural language models can automatically generate new RoTs that reasonably describe previously unseen interactions, but they still struggle with certain scenarios. Our findings suggest that MIC will be a useful resource for understanding and language models' implicit moral assumptions and flexibly benchmarking the integrity of conversational agents.

With a small amount of found data, such attributes can be inferred and exploited for malicious purposes: voice cloning, spoofing, etc. Anonymization aims to make the data unlinkable, i.e., ensure that no utterance can be linked to its original speaker. In this paper, we investigate anonymization methods based on voice conversion. In contrast to prior work, we argue that various linkage attacks can be designed depending on the attackers' knowledge about the anonymization scheme. We compare two frequency warping-based conversion methods and a deep learning based method in three attack scenarios. The utility of converted speech is measured via the word error rate achieved by automatic speech recognition, while privacy protection is assessed by the increase in equal error rate achieved by state-of-the-art i-vector or x-vector based speaker verification. Our results show that voice conversion schemes are unable to effectively protect against an attacker that has extensive knowledge of the type of conversion and how it has been applied, but may provide some protection against less knowledgeable attackers.",

Our idea is to explicitly exploit the unequal contribution of spatial regions to guide talking portrait modeling. Specifically, to improve the accuracy of dynamic head reconstruction, a compact and expressive NeRF-based Tri-Plane Hash Representation is introduced by pruning empty spatial regions with three planar hash encoders. For speech audio, we propose a Region Attention Module to generate region-aware condition feature via an attention mechanism. Different from existing methods that utilize an MLP-based encoder to learn the cross-modal relation implicitly, the attention mechanism builds an explicit connection between audio features and spatial regions to capture the priors of local motions. Moreover, a direct and fast Adaptive Pose Encoding is introduced to optimize the head-torso separation problem by mapping the complex transformation of the head pose into spatial coordinates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method renders better high-fidelity and audio-lips synchronized talking portrait videos, with realistic details and high efficiency compared to previous methods.",

Specifically, we design a novel two-pathway architecture, in which the scene branch encodes the scene geometry and appearance, and the object branch encodes each standalone object conditioned on learnable object activation codes. To survive the training in heavily cluttered scenes, we propose a scene-guided training strategy to solve the 3D space ambiguity in the occluded regions and learn sharp boundaries for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system not only achieves competitive performance for static scene novel-view synthesis, but also produces realistic rendering for object-level editing.",

However, it remains underexplored how the appearance of such representations can be efficiently edited while maintaining photorealism. In this work, we present PaletteNeRF, a novel method for photorealistic appearance editing of neural radiance fields (NeRF) based on 3D color decomposition. Our method decomposes the appearance of each 3D point into a linear combination of palette-based bases (i.e., 3D segmentations defined by a group of NeRF-type functions) that are shared across the scene. While our palette-based bases are view-independent, we also predict a view-dependent function to capture the color residual (e.g., specular shading). During training, we jointly optimize the basis functions and the color palettes, and we also introduce novel regularizers to encourage the spatial coherence of the decomposition. Our method allows users to efficiently edit the appearance of the 3D scene by modifying the color palettes. We also extend our framework with compressed semantic features for semantic-aware appearance editing. We demonstrate that our technique is superior to baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively for appearance editing of complex real-world scenes.",

We experiment with 10 different types of perturbations on 4 multi-turn dialog datasets and find that commonly used neural dialog architectures like recurrent and transformer-based seq2seq models are rarely sensitive to most perturbations such as missing or reordering utterances, shuffling words, etc. Also, by open-sourcing our code, we believe that it will serve as a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating dialog systems in the future.",

We show that a single handheld consumer-grade camera is sufficient to synthesize sophisticated renderings of a dynamic scene from novel virtual camera views, e.g. a `bullet-time' video effect. NR-NeRF disentangles the dynamic scene into a canonical volume and its deformation. Scene deformation is implemented as ray bending, where straight rays are deformed non-rigidly. We also propose a novel rigidity network to better constrain rigid regions of the scene, leading to more stable results. The ray bending and rigidity network are trained without explicit supervision.

        "content1": "In this paper, we present statistical approaches to enhance body-conducted unvoiced speech for silent speech communication. A body-conductive microphone called nonaudible murmur (NAM) microphone is effectively used to detect very soft unvoiced speech such as NAM or a whispered voice while keeping speech sounds emitted outside almost inaudible. However, body-conducted unvoiced speech is difficult to use in human-to-human speech communication because it sounds unnatural and less intelligible owing to the acoustic change caused by body conduction. To address this issue, voice conversion (VC) methods from NAM to normal speech (NAM-to-Speech) and to a whispered voice (NAM-to-Whisper) are proposed, where the acoustic features of body-conducted unvoiced speech are converted into those of natural voices in a probabilistic manner using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Moreover, these methods are extended to convert not only NAM but also a body-conducted whispered voice (BCW) as another type of body-conducted unvoiced speech. Several experimental evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The experimental results show that 1) NAM-to-Speech effectively improves intelligibility but it causes degradation of naturalness owing to the difficulty of estimating natural fundamental frequency contours from unvoiced speech; 2) NAM-to-Whisper significantly outperforms NAM-to-Speech in terms of both intelligibility and naturalness; and 3) a single conversion model capable of converting both NAM and BCW is effectively developed in our proposed VC methods.",

In contrast to all previous NeRF methods, DIVeR uses deterministic rather than stochastic estimates of the volume rendering integral. DIVeR's representation is a voxel based field of features. To compute the volume rendering integral, a ray is broken into intervals, one per voxel; components of the volume rendering integral are estimated from the features for each interval using an MLP, and the components are aggregated. As a result, DIVeR can render thin translucent structures that are missed by other integrators. Furthermore, DIVeR's representation has semantics that is relatively exposed compared to other such methods -- moving feature vectors around in the voxel space results in natural edits. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons to current state-of-the-art methods show that DIVeR produces models that (1) render at or above state-of-the-art quality, (2) are very small without being baked, (3) render very fast without being baked, and (4) can be edited in natural ways.",

In our setting, each individual MLP only needs to represent parts of the scene, thus smaller and faster-to-evaluate MLPs can be used. By combining this divide-and-conquer strategy with further optimizations, rendering is accelerated by three orders of magnitude compared to the original NeRF model without incurring high storage costs.

These priors are generated by correcting scale and shift parameters during training, with which we are then able to constrain the relative poses between consecutive frames. This constraint is achieved using our proposed novel loss functions. Experiments on real-world indoor and outdoor scenes show that our method can handle challenging camera trajectories and outperforms existing methods in terms of novel view rendering quality and pose estimation accuracy.

However, leveraging multiple sequences captured by different cameras at different times is essential for better reconstruction performance. Multi-sequence data takes two main challenges: appearance variation due to different lighting conditions and non-static objects like pedestrians. To address these issues, we propose NeRF-MS, a novel approach to training NeRF with multi-sequence data. Specifically, we utilize a triplet loss to regularize the distribution of per-image appearance code, which leads to better high-frequency texture and consistent appearance, such as specular reflections. Then, we explicitly model non-static objects to reduce floaters. Extensive results demonstrate that NeRF-MS not only outperforms state-of-the-art view synthesis methods on outdoor and synthetic scenes, but also achieves 3D consistent rendering and robust appearance controlling.

The standard approach to constructing neural radiance fields takes advantage of multi-view consistency and requires many calibrated views of a scene, a requirement that cannot be satisfied when learning on large-scale image data in the wild. We take a step towards addressing this shortcoming by introducing a model that encodes the input image into a disentangled object representation that contains a code for object shape, a code for object appearance, and an estimated camera pose from which the object image is captured. Our model conditions a NeRF on the predicted object representation and uses volume rendering to generate images from novel views. We train the model end-to-end on a large collection of input images. As the model is only provided with single-view images, the problem is highly under-constrained. Therefore, in addition to using a reconstruction loss on the synthesized input view, we use an auxiliary adversarial loss on the novel rendered views. Furthermore, we leverage object symmetry and cycle camera pose consistency. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on the ShapeNet dataset as well as qualitative experiments on Open Images dataset. We show that in all cases, im2nerf achieves the state-of-the-art performance for novel view synthesis from a single-view unposed image in the wild.",

By querying spatial points and view directions, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) can be trained to output the volume density and radiance at each point, which lets us render novel views of the scene. The original NeRF and its recent variants, however, target opaque scenes dominated by diffuse reflection surfaces and cannot handle complex refractive surfaces well. We introduce NeRFrac to realize neural novel view synthesis of scenes captured through refractive surfaces, typically water surfaces. For each queried ray, an MLP-based Refractive Field is trained to estimate the distance from the ray origin to the refractive surface. A refracted ray at each intersection point is then computed by Snell's Law, given the input ray and the approximated local normal. Points of the scene are sampled along the refracted ray and are sent to a Radiance Field for further radiance estimation. We show that from a sparse set of images, our model achieves accurate novel view synthesis of the scene underneath the refractive surface and simultaneously reconstructs the refractive surface. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method with synthetic and real scenes seen through water surfaces.

This can cause significant problems for downstream tasks such as navigation, inspection, or visualization of the scene. To alleviate these problems, we present E-NeRF, the first method which estimates a volumetric scene representation in the form of a NeRF from a fast-moving event camera. Our method can recover NeRFs during very fast motion and in high-dynamic-range conditions where frame-based approaches fail. We show that rendering high-quality frames is possible by only providing an event stream as input. Furthermore, by combining events and frames, we can estimate NeRFs of higher quality than state-of-the-art approaches under severe motion blur. We also show that combining events and frames can overcome failure cases of NeRF estimation in scenarios where only a few input views are available without requiring additional regularization.",

The proposed method is evaluated on CoversMusic and a public question answering dataset. Our proposed GenDS system outperforms baseline methods significantly in terms of the BLEU, entity accuracy, entity recall and human evaluation. Moreover,the experiments also demonstrate that GenDS works better even on small datasets.",

        "content1": "Recent progress on multi-view 3D object reconstruction has featured neural implicit surfaces via learning high-fidelity radiance fields. However, most approaches hinge on the visual hull derived from cost-expensive silhouette masks to obtain object surfaces. In this paper, we propose a novel Object-aware Radiance Fields (ORF) to automatically learn an object-aware geometry reconstruction. The geometric correspondences between multi-view 2D object regions and 3D implicit/explicit object surfaces are additionally exploited to boost the learning of object surfaces. Technically, a critical transparency discriminator is designed to distinguish the object-intersected and object-bypassed rays based on the estimated 2D object regions, leading to 3D implicit object surfaces. Such implicit surfaces can be directly converted into explicit object surfaces (e.g., meshes) via marching cubes. Then, we build the geometric correspondence between 2D planes and 3D meshes by rasterization, and project the estimated object regions into 3D explicit object surfaces by aggregating the object information across multiple views. The aggregated object information in 3D explicit object surfaces is further reprojected back to 2D planes, aiming to update 2D object regions and enforce them to be multi-view consistent. Extensive experiments on DTU and BlendedMVS verify the capability of ORF to produce comparable surfaces against the state-of-the-art models that demand silhouette masks.",

Modularized systems rely on DST to interact with the KB, which is expensive in terms of annotation and inference time. End-to-end systems use the KB directly as input, but they cannot scale when the KB is larger than a few hundred entries. In this paper, we propose a method to embed the KB, of any size, directly into the model parameters. The resulting model does not require any DST or template responses, nor the KB as input, and it can dynamically update its KB via fine-tuning. We evaluate our solution in five task-oriented dialogue datasets with small, medium, and large KB size.

In this work, we explore the impact of incorporating the audio features of the user message into generative dialogue systems. Specifically, we first design an auxiliary response retrieval task for audio representation learning. Then, we use word-level modality fusion to incorporate the audio features as additional context to our main generative model.

We conduct a between-subjects study to understand the impact of four experiment conditions on human ratings of dialogue system output. In addition to discrete and continuous scale ratings, we also experiment with a novel application of Best-Worst scaling to dialogue evaluation. Through our systematic study with 40 crowdsourced workers in each task, we find that using continuous scales achieves more consistent ratings than Likert scale or ranking-based experiment design. Additionally, we find that factors such as time taken to complete the task and no prior experience of participating in similar studies of rating dialogue system output positively impact consistency and agreement amongst raters",

        "content1": "The basic goal of the voice conversion system is to modify the speaker-specific characteristics, keeping the message and the environmental information contained in the speech signal intact. Speaker characteristics reflect in speech at different levels, such as, the shape of the glottal pulse (excitation source characteristics), the shape of the vocal tract (vocal tract system characteristics) and the long-term features (suprasegmental or prosodic characteristics). In this paper, we are proposing neural network models for developing mapping functions at each level. The features used for developing the mapping functions are extracted using pitch synchronous analysis. Pitch synchronous analysis provides the estimation of accurate vocal tract parameters, by analyzing the speech signal independently in each pitch period without influenced by the adjacent pitch cycles. In this work, the instants of significant excitation are used as pitch markers to perform the pitch synchronous analysis. The instants of significant excitation correspond to the instants of glottal closure (epochs) in the case of voiced speech, and to some random excitations like onset of burst in the case of nonvoiced speech. Instants of significant excitation are computed from the linear prediction (LP) residual of speech signals by using the property of average group-delay of minimum phase signals. In this paper, line spectral frequencies (LSFs) are used for representing the vocal tract characteristics, and for developing its associated mapping function. LP residual of the speech signal is viewed as excitation source, and the residual samples around the instant of glottal closure are used for mapping. Prosodic parameters at syllable and phrase levels are used for deriving the mapping function. Source and system level mapping functions are derived pitch synchronously, and the incorporation of target prosodic parameters is performed pitch synchronously using instants of significant excitation. The performance of the voice conversion system is evaluated using listening tests. The prediction accuracy of the mapping functions (neural network models) used at different levels in the proposed voice conversion system is further evaluated using objective measures such as deviation (\nD\ni\n)\n, root mean square error (\nμ\nRMSE\n) and correlation coefficient (\nγ\nX\n,\nY\n). The proposed approach (i.e., mapping and modification of parameters using pitch synchronous approach) used for voice conversion is shown to be performed better compared to the earlier method (mapping the vocal tract parameters using block processing) proposed by the author.",
        "content2": "Generating complex multi-turn goal-oriented dialogue agents is a difficult problem that has seen a considerable focus from many leaders in the tech industry, including IBM, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. This is in large part due to the rapidly growing market demand for dialogue agents capable of goal-oriented behaviour. Due to the business process nature of these conversations, end-to-end machine learning systems are generally not a viable option, as the generated dialogue agents must be deployable and verifiable on behalf of the businesses authoring them.\n  In this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the creation of goal-oriented complex dialogue systems that dramatically eliminates the need for a designer to manually specify a dialogue tree, which nearly all current systems have to resort to when the interaction pattern falls outside standard patterns such as slot filling. We propose a declarative representation of the dialogue agent to be processed by state-of-the-art planning technology. Our proposed approach covers all aspects of the process; from model solicitation to the execution of the generated plans/dialogue agents. Along the way, we introduce novel planning encodings for declarative dialogue synthesis, a variety of interfaces for working with the specification as a dialogue architect, and a robust executor for generalized contingent plans. We have created prototype implementations of all components, and in this paper, we further demonstrate the resulting system empirically.",

We propose an algorithm for navigating a robot through a 3D environment represented as a NeRF using only an onboard RGB camera for localization. We assume the NeRF for the scene has been pre-trained offline, and the robot&#x2019;s objective is to navigate through unoccupied space in the NeRF to reach a goal pose. We introduce a trajectory optimization algorithm that avoids collisions with high-density regions in the NeRF based on a discrete time version of differential flatness that is amenable to constraining the robot&#x2019;s full pose and control inputs. We also introduce an optimization based filtering method to estimate 6DoF pose and velocities for the robot in the NeRF given only an onboard RGB camera.

Current conversion algorithms employ a training procedure, during which the same utterances spoken by both the source and target speakers are needed for deriving the desired conversion parameters. Such a (parallel) corpus, is often difficult or impossible to collect. Here, we propose an algorithm that relaxes this constraint, i.e., the training corpus does not necessarily contain the same utterances from both speakers. The proposed algorithm is based on speaker adaptation techniques, adapting the conversion parameters derived for a particular pair of speakers to a different pair, for which only a nonparallel corpus is available. We show that adaptation reduces the error obtained when simply applying the conversion parameters of one pair of speakers to another by a factor that can reach 30%. A speaker identification measure is also employed that more insightfully portrays the importance of adaptation, while listening tests confirm the success of our method. Both the objective and subjective tests employed, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable results with the ideal case when a parallel corpus is available.",

While traditional pipelines struggle with objects like these, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have recently been shown to be remarkably effective for performing view synthesis on objects with thin structures or reflective materials. In this paper we explore the use of NeRF as a new source of supervision for robust robot vision systems. In particular, we demonstrate that a NeRF representation of a scene can be used to train dense object descriptors. We use an optimized NeRF to extract dense correspondences between multiple views of an object, and then use these correspondences as training data for learning a view-invariant representation of the object. NeRF's usage of a density field allows us to reformulate the correspondence problem with a novel distribution-of-depths formulation, as opposed to the conventional approach of using a depth map. Dense correspondence models supervised with our method significantly outperform off-the-shelf learned descriptors by 106% (PCK@3px metric, more than doubling performance) and outperform our baseline supervised with multi-view stereo by 29%. Furthermore, we demonstrate the learned dense descriptors enable robots to perform accurate 6-degree of freedom (6-DoF) pick and place of thin and reflective objects.",

        "content1": "Open-domain human-computer conversation has attracted much attention in the field of NLP. Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information. The generated reply is then fed back as a new candidate for post-reranking. Experimental results show that such ensemble outperforms each single part of it by a large margin.",

One RTRBM is used for each speaker, with the goal of capturing high-order temporal dependencies in an acoustic sequence. Our algorithm starts from the separate training of one RTRBM for a source speaker and another for a target speaker using speaker-dependent training data. Because each RTRBM attempts to discover abstractions to maximally express the training data at each time step, as well as the temporal dependencies in the training data, we expect that the models represent the linguistic-related latent features in high-order spaces. In our approach, we convert (match) features of emphasis for the source speaker to those of the target speaker using a neural network (NN), so that the entire network (consisting of the two RTRBMs and the NN) acts as a deep recurrent NN and can be fine-tuned. Using VC experiments, we confirm the high performance of our method, especially in terms of objective criteria, relative to conventional VC methods such as approaches based on Gaussian mixture models and on NNs.",

First, we take advantage of the sparse depth data that is freely available from the structure from motion (SfM) preprocessing step used to estimate camera poses. Second, we use depth completion to convert these sparse points into dense depth maps and uncertainty estimates, which are used to guide NeRF optimization.

While the method explicitly models the context-dependent acoustic confusability of words and allows the system specific language model and semantic decoder to be incorporated, it is computationally inexpensive and thus potentially suitable for running thousands of training simulations. Experimental evaluation results with a POMDP-based dialogue system and the Hidden Agenda User Simulator indicate a close match between the statistical properties of real and synthetic errors.",

However, F0 can robustly represent various prosody signals (e.g., emotional prosody). In this study, we propose an effective method based on the NNs to train the normalized-segment-F0 features (NSF0) for emotional prosody conversion. Meanwhile, the proposed method adopts deep belief networks (DBNs) to train spectrum features for voice conversion. By using these approaches, the proposed method can change the spectrum and the prosody for the emotional voice at the same time. Moreover, the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for voice emotional conversion.",

Then we design a pose-driven deformation field to establish correspondence from those different poses to a shared canonical space, where a pose-disentangled NeRF for one hand is optimized. Such unified modeling efficiently complements the geometry and texture cues in rarely-observed areas for both hands. Meanwhile, we further leverage the pose priors to generate pseudo depth maps as guidance for occlusion-aware density learning. Moreover, a neural feature distillation method is proposed to achieve cross-domain alignment for color optimization.

In this paper, we propose a modification of the conventional training process for VC that allows it to perform as an AC transform. Namely, we pair source and target vectors based not on their ordering within a parallel corpus, as is commonly done in VC, but based on their linguistic similarity. We validate the approach on a corpus containing native-accented and Spanish-accented utterances, and compare it against conventional VC through a series of listening tests. We also analyze whether phonological differences between the two languages (Spanish and American English) help predict the performance of the two methods.",

In this paper, we present the first large-scale study on persona biases in dialogue systems and conduct analyses on personas of different social classes, sexual orientations, races, and genders. We define persona biases as harmful differences in responses (e.g., varying levels of offensiveness, agreement with harmful statements) generated from adopting different demographic personas. Furthermore, we introduce an open-source framework, UnitPersonaBias, to explore and aggregate persona biases in dialogue systems. By analyzing the Blender and DialoGPT dialogue systems, we observe that adopting personas can actually decrease harmful responses, compared to not using any personas. Additionally, we find that persona choices can affect the degree of harms in generated responses and thus should be systematically evaluated before deployment. We also analyze how personas can result in different amounts of harm towards specific demographics.",

        "content1": "This paper describes two flexible frameworks of voice conversion (VC), i.e., one-to-many VC and many-to-one VC. One-to-many VC realizes the conversion from a user's voice as a source to arbitrary target speakers' ones and many-to-one VC realizes the conversion vice versa. We apply eigenvoice conversion (EVC) to both VC frameworks. Using multiple parallel data sets consisting of utterance-pairs of the user and multiple pre-stored speakers, an eigenvoice Gaussian mixture model (EV-GMM) is trained in advance. Unsupervised adaptation of the EV-GMM is available to construct the conversion model for arbitrary target speakers in one-to-many VC or arbitrary source speakers in many-to-one VC using only a small amount of their speech data. Results of various experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VC frameworks.",

Both the ANN and GMM based models are explored to capture nonlinear mapping functions for modifying the vocal tract characteristics of a source speaker according to a desired target speaker. The LSFs are used to represent the vocal tract transfer function of a particular speaker. Mapping of the intonation patterns (pitch contour) is carried out using a codebook based model at segmental level. The energy profile of the signal is modified using a fixed scaling factor defined between the source and target speakers at the segmental level. Two different methods for residual modification such as residual copying and residual selection methods are used to generate the target residual signal. The performance of ANN and GMM based voice conversion (VC) system are conducted using subjective and objective measures. The results indicate that the proposed ANN-based model using LSFs feature set may be used as an alternative to state-of-the-art GMM-based models used to design a voice conversion system.",

The proposed approach first obtains PPGs of target speech. Then, a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Recurrent Neural Network (DBLSTM) structure is used to model the relationships between the PPGs and acoustic features of the target speech. To convert arbitrary source speech, we obtain its PPGs from the same SI-ASR and feed them into the trained DBLSTM for generating converted speech. Our approach has two main advantages: 1) no parallel training data is required; 2) a trained model can be applied to any other source speaker for a fixed target speaker (i.e., many-to-one conversion). Experiments show that our approach performs equally well or better than state-of-the-art systems in both speech quality and speaker similarity.",

Some recent works have proposed to decompose a non-rigidly deforming scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of deformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space, thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field, which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these representations cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we introduce neural blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based on the skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human skeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can regularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend weight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new deformation fields to animate the human model. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent human synthesis methods.

Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information.

As voice conversion aims at the transformation of a source speaker's voice into that of a target speaker, we want to investigate whether VTLN is an appropriate method to adapt the voice characteristics. After applying several conventional VTLN warping functions, we extend the piecewise linear function to several segments, allowing a more detailed warping of the source spectrum. Experiments on voice conversion are performed on three corpora of two languages and both speaker genders.",

Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based conversion is commonly used, but it is subject to overfitting. In this paper, we propose to use partial least squares (PLS)-based transforms in voice conversion. To prevent overfitting, the degrees of freedom in the mapping can be controlled by choosing a suitable number of components. We propose a technique to combine PLS with GMMs, enabling the use of multiple local linear mappings. To further improve the perceptual quality of the mapping where rapid transitions between GMM components produce audible artefacts, we propose to low-pass filter the component posterior probabilities. The conducted experiments show that the proposed technique results in better subjective and objective quality than the baseline joint density GMM approach. In speech quality conversion preference tests, the proposed method achieved 67% preference score against the smoothed joint density GMM method and 84% preference score against the unsmoothed joint density GMM method.

        "content2": " in this paper we present statistical approaches to enhance body-conducted unvoiced speech for silent speech communicationA body-conductive microphone called nonaudible murmur (NAM) microphone is effectively used to detect very soft unvoiced speech such as NAM or a whispered voice while keeping speech sounds emitted outside almost inaudible.However, body-conducted unvoiced speech is difficult to use in human-to-human speech communication because it sounds unnatural and less intelligible owing to the acoustic change caused by body conduction.To address this issue, voice conversion (VC) methods from NAM to normal speech (NAM-to-Speech) and to a whispered voice (NAM-to-Whisper) are proposed, where the acoustic features of body-conducted unvoiced speech are converted into those of natural voices in a probabilistic manner using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs).Moreover, these methods are extended to convert not only NAM but also a body-conducted whispered voice (BCW) as another type of body-conducted unvoiced speech.several experimental evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed methodsThe experimental results show that 1) NAM-to-Speech effectively improves intelligibility but it causes degradation of naturalness owing to the difficulty of estimating natural fundamental frequency contours from unvoiced speech; 2) NAM-to-Whisper significantly outperforms NAM-to-Speech in terms of both intelligibility and naturalness; and 3) a single conversion model capable of converting both NAM and BCW is effectively developed in our proposed VC methods.",

        "content1": "This article presents a method of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) voice conversion using non-parallel training data. In this method, disentangled linguistic and speaker representations are extracted from acoustic features, and voice conversion is achieved by preserving the linguistic representations of source utterances while replacing the speaker representations with the target ones. Our model is built under the framework of encoder-decoder neural networks. A recognition encoder is designed to learn the disentangled linguistic representations with two strategies. First, phoneme transcriptions of training data are introduced to provide the references for leaning linguistic representations of audio signals. Second, an adversarial training strategy is employed to further wipe out speaker information from the linguistic representations. Meanwhile, speaker representations are extracted from audio signals by a speaker encoder. The model parameters are estimated by two-stage training, including a pre-training stage using a multi-speaker dataset and a fine-tuning stage using the dataset of a specific conversion pair. Since both the recognition encoder and the decoder for recovering acoustic features are seq2seq neural networks, there are no constrains of frame alignment and frame-by-frame conversion in our proposed method. Experimental results showed that our method obtained higher similarity and naturalness than the best non-parallel voice conversion method in Voice Conversion Challenge 2018. Besides, the performance of our proposed method was closed to the state-of-the-art parallel seq2seq voice conversion method.",

The parallel exemplars (dictionary) consist of the source exemplars and target exemplars, having the same texts uttered by the source and target speakers. The input source signal is decomposed into the source exemplars, noise exemplars obtained from the input signal, and their weights (activities). Then, by using the weights of the source exemplars, the converted signal is constructed from the target exemplars. We carried out speaker conversion tasks using clean speech data and noise-added speech data. The effectiveness of this method was confirmed by comparing its effectiveness with that of a conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based method.",

        "content1": "Voice conversion (VC) using sequence-to-sequence learning of context posterior probabilities is proposed. Conventional VC using shared context posterior probabilities predicts target speech parameters from the context posterior probabilities estimated from the source speech parameters. Although conventional VC can be built from non-parallel data, it is difficult to convert speaker individuality such as phonetic property and speaking rate contained in the posterior probabilities because the source posterior probabilities are directly used for predicting target speech parameters. In this work, we assume that the training data partly include parallel speech data and propose sequence-to-sequence learning between the source and target posterior probabilities. The conversion models perform non-linear and variable-length transformation from the source probability sequence to the target one. Further, we propose a joint training algorithm for the modules. In contrast to conventional VC, which separately trains the speech recognition that estimates posterior probabilities and the speech synthesis that predicts target speech parameters, our proposed method jointly trains these modules along with the proposed probability conversion modules. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the conventional VC.",

Compared with conventional frame-to-frame voice conversion approaches, the seq2seq acoustic modeling method proposed in our previous work achieved higher naturalness and similarity. In this paper, we further improve its performance by utilizing the text transcriptions of parallel training data. First, a multi-task learning structure is designed which adds auxiliary classifiers to the middle layers of the seq2seq model and predicts linguistic labels as a secondary task. Second, a data-augmentation method is proposed which utilizes text alignment to produce extra parallel sequences for model training. Experiments are conducted to evaluate our proposed method with training sets at different sizes. Experimental results show that the multi-task learning with linguistic labels is effective at reducing the errors of seq2seq voice conversion. The data-augmentation method can further improve the performance of seq2seq voice conversion when only 50 or 100 training utterances are available.",

While preserving the common characteristics of a given input condition, the proposed model generates diverse images in fine detail. We propose: 1) a novel unified architecture which disentangles the shape and appearance from a condition given in various forms and 2) the pose-consistent diversity loss for generating multimodal outputs while maintaining consistency of the view. Experimental results show that the proposed method maintains consistent image quality on various condition types and achieves superior fidelity and diversity compared to existing NeRF-based generative models.",

Modern dialogue systems may consider adopting anthropomorphic personas, mimicking societal demographic groups to appear more approachable and trustworthy to users. However, the adoption of a persona can result in the adoption of biases. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study on persona biases in dialogue systems and conduct analyses on personas of different social classes, sexual orientations, races, and genders. We define persona biases as harmful differences in responses (e.g., varying levels of offensiveness, agreement with harmful statements) generated from adopting different demographic personas. Furthermore, we introduce an open-source framework, UnitPersonaBias, to explore and aggregate persona biases in dialogue systems. By analyzing the Blender and DialoGPT dialogue systems, we observe that adopting personas can actually decrease harmful responses, compared to not using any personas. Additionally, we find that persona choices can affect the degree of harms in generated responses and thus should be systematically evaluated before deployment. We also analyze how personas can result in different amounts of harm towards specific demographics.",

They offer flexibility, can be easily adapted to new domains, and require minimal domain engineering. A common criticism of these systems is that they seldom understand or use the available dialog history effectively. In this paper, we take an empirical approach to understanding how these models use the available dialog history by studying the sensitivity of the models to artificially introduced unnatural changes or perturbations to their context at test time. We experiment with 10 different types of perturbations on 4 multi-turn dialog datasets and find that commonly used neural dialog architectures like recurrent and transformer-based seq2seq models are rarely sensitive to most perturbations such as missing or reordering utterances, shuffling words, etc. Also, by open-sourcing our code, we believe that it will serve as a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating dialog systems in the future.",

Popular methods for learning task-oriented dialogues include applying reinforcement learning with user feedback on supervised pre-training models. Efficiency of such learning method may suffer from the mismatch of dialogue state distribution between offline training and online interactive learning stages. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid imitation and reinforcement learning method, with which a dialogue agent can effectively learn from its interaction with users by learning from human teaching and feedback. We design a neural network based task-oriented dialogue agent that can be optimized end-to-end with the proposed learning method. Experimental results show that our end-to-end dialogue agent can learn effectively from the mistake it makes via imitation learning from user teaching. Applying reinforcement learning with user feedback after the imitation learning stage further improves the agent's capability in successfully completing a task.",

To this end, we propose a novel Tri-Mip encoding (a la \"mipmap\") that enables both instant reconstruction and anti-aliased high-fidelity rendering for neural radiance fields. The key is to factorize the pre-filtered 3D feature spaces in three orthogonal mipmaps. In this way, we can efficiently perform 3D area sampling by taking advantage of 2D pre-filtered feature maps, which significantly elevates the rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency. To cope with the novel Tri-Mip representation, we propose a cone-casting rendering technique to efficiently sample anti-aliased 3D features with the Tri-Mip encoding considering both pixel imaging and observing distance. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and reconstruction speed while maintaining a compact representation that reduces 25% model size compared against Instant-ngp.

To compensate for inaccurate pose estimation, we introduce the pose refinement strategy that updates the initial pose during the learning process, which not only helps to learn more accurate human reconstruction but also accelerates the convergence.

This methodology is based on a classification procedure that considers all of the previous history of the dialog to select the next system answer. To evaluate the performance of the dialog system, the statistical approach for dialog management has been extended to model the user behavior. The statistical user simulator has been used for the evaluation and improvement of the dialog strategy. Both the user model and the system model are automatically learned from a training corpus that is labeled in terms of dialog acts. New measures have been defined to evaluate the performance of the dialog system. Using these measures, we evaluate both the quality of the simulated dialogs and the improvement of the new dialog strategy that is obtained with the interaction of the two modules. This methodology has been applied to develop a dialog manager within the framework of the DIHANA project, whose goal is the design and development of a dialog system to access a railway information system using spontaneous speech in Spanish.

This paper investigates voice conversion and modification techniques to reduce database collection and processing efforts while maintaining acceptable quality and naturalness. In a factorial design, we study the relative contributions of voice quality and prosody as well as the amount of distortions introduced by the respective signal manipulation steps. The unit selection engine in our open source and modular text-to-speech (TTS) framework MARY is extended with voice quality transformation using either GMM-based prediction or vocal tract copy resynthesis. These algorithms are then cross-combined with various prosody copy resynthesis methods. The overall expressive speech generation process functions as a postprocessing step on TTS outputs to transform neutral synthetic speech into aggressive, cheerful, or depressed speech. Cross-combinations of voice quality and prosody transformation algorithms are compared in listening tests for perceived expressive style and quality. The results show that there is a tradeoff between identification and naturalness. Combined modeling of both voice quality and prosody leads to the best identification scores at the expense of lowest naturalness ratings. The fine detail of both voice quality and prosody, as preserved by the copy synthesis, did contribute to a better identification as compared to the approximate models.",

Our idea is to explicitly exploit the unequal contribution of spatial regions to guide talking portrait modeling. Specifically, to improve the accuracy of dynamic head reconstruction, a compact and expressive NeRF-based Tri-Plane Hash Representation is introduced by pruning empty spatial regions with three planar hash encoders. For speech audio, we propose a Region Attention Module to generate region-aware condition feature via an attention mechanism. Different from existing methods that utilize an MLP-based encoder to learn the cross-modal relation implicitly, the attention mechanism builds an explicit connection between audio features and spatial regions to capture the priors of local motions. Moreover, a direct and fast Adaptive Pose Encoding is introduced to optimize the head-torso separation problem by mapping the complex transformation of the head pose into spatial coordinates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method renders better high-fidelity and audio-lips synchronized talking portrait videos, with realistic details and high efficiency compared to previous methods.",

In this paper, we investigate anonymization methods based on voice conversion. In contrast to prior work, we argue that various linkage attacks can be designed depending on the attackers' knowledge about the anonymization scheme. We compare two frequency warping-based conversion methods and a deep learning based method in three attack scenarios. The utility of converted speech is measured via the word error rate achieved by automatic speech recognition, while privacy protection is assessed by the increase in equal error rate achieved by state-of-the-art i-vector or x-vector based speaker verification.

        "content1": "Recent progress on multi-view 3D object reconstruction has featured neural implicit surfaces via learning high-fidelity radiance fields. However, most approaches hinge on the visual hull derived from cost-expensive silhouette masks to obtain object surfaces. In this paper, we propose a novel Object-aware Radiance Fields (ORF) to automatically learn an object-aware geometry reconstruction. The geometric correspondences between multi-view 2D object regions and 3D implicit/explicit object surfaces are additionally exploited to boost the learning of object surfaces. Technically, a critical transparency discriminator is designed to distinguish the object-intersected and object-bypassed rays based on the estimated 2D object regions, leading to 3D implicit object surfaces. Such implicit surfaces can be directly converted into explicit object surfaces (e.g., meshes) via marching cubes. Then, we build the geometric correspondence between 2D planes and 3D meshes by rasterization, and project the estimated object regions into 3D explicit object surfaces by aggregating the object information across multiple views. The aggregated object information in 3D explicit object surfaces is further reprojected back to 2D planes, aiming to update 2D object regions and enforce them to be multi-view consistent. Extensive experiments on DTU and BlendedMVS verify the capability of ORF to produce comparable surfaces against the state-of-the-art models that demand silhouette masks.",

Recent NeRF-based advances have gained popularity for remarkable realistic novel view synthesis. However, most of them heavily rely on accurate camera poses estimation, while few recent methods can only optimize the unknown camera poses in roughly forward-facing scenes with relatively short camera trajectories and require rough camera poses initialization. Differently, our GNeRF only utilizes randomly initialized poses for complex outside-in scenarios. We propose a novel two-phases end-to-end framework. The first phase takes the use of GANs into the new realm for optimizing coarse camera poses and radiance fields jointly, while the second phase refines them with additional photometric loss. We overcome local minima using a hybrid and iterative optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on a variety of synthetic and natural scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of GNeRF. More impressively, our approach outperforms the baselines favorably in those scenes with repeated patterns or even low textures that are regarded as extremely challenging before.",

However, it is difficult to reconstruct a sharp NeRF from blurry input as often occurred in the wild. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Event-Enhanced NeRF (E2NeRF) by utilizing the combination data of a bio-inspired event camera and a standard RGB camera. To effectively introduce event stream into the learning process of neural volumetric representation, we propose a blur rendering loss and an event rendering loss, which guide the network via modelling real blur process and event generation process, respectively. Moreover, a camera pose estimation framework for real-world data is built with the guidance of event stream to generalize the method to practical applications. In contrast to previous image-based or event-based NeRF, our framework effectively utilizes the internal relationship between events and images. As a result, E2NeRF not only achieves image deblurring but also achieves high-quality novel view image generation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate that E2NeRF can effectively learn a sharp NeRF from blurry images, especially in complex and low-light scenes.

The reinforcement learning based dialogue manager offers robust capabilities to handle noises caused by other components of the dialogue system.

        "content1": "A drawback of many voice conversion algorithms is that they rely on linear models and/or require a lot of tuning. In addition, many of them ignore the inherent time-dependency between speech features. To address these issues, we propose to use dynamic kernel partial least squares (DKPLS) technique to model nonlinearities as well as to capture the dynamics in the data. The method is based on a kernel transformation of the source features to allow non-linear modeling and concatenation of previous and next frames to model the dynamics. Partial least squares regression is used to find a conversion function that does not overfit to the data. The resulting DKPLS algorithm is a simple and efficient algorithm and does not require massive tuning. Existing statistical methods proposed for voice conversion are able to produce good similarity between the original and the converted target voices but the quality is usually degraded. The experiments conducted on a variety of conversion pairs show that DKPLS, being a statistical method, enables successful identity conversion while achieving a major improvement in the quality scores compared to the state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture-based model. In addition to enabling better spectral feature transformation, quality is further improved when aperiodicity and binary voicing values are converted using DKPLS with auxiliary information from spectral features.",
        "content2": "Beyond the common difficulties faced in task-oriented dialogue system, medical dialogue has recently attracted increasing attention due to its huge application potential while posing more challenges in reasoning over medical domain knowledge and logic. Existing works resort to neural language models for dialogue embedding and neglect the explicit logical reasoning, leading to poor explainable and generalization ability. In this work, we propose an explainable Heterogeneous Graph Reasoning (HGR) model to unify the relational dialogue context understanding and entity-correlation reasoning into a heterogeneous graph structure. HGR encodes entity context according to the corresponding utterance and deduces next response after fusing the underlying medical knowledge with entity context by attentional graph propagation. To push forward the future research on expert-sensitive task-oriented dialogue system, we first release a large-scale Medical Dialogue Consultant benchmark (MDG-C) with 16 Gastrointestinal diseases for evaluating consultant capability and a Medical Dialogue Diagnosis benchmark (MDG-D) with 6 diseases for measuring diagnosis capability of models, respectively. Extensive experiments on both MDG-C and MDG-D benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our HGR over state-of-the-art knowledge grounded approaches in general fields of medical dialogue system.",

        "content1": "Substantial improvements have been achieved in recent years in voice conversion, which converts the speaker characteristics of an utterance into those of another speaker without changing the linguistic content of the utterance. Nonetheless, the improved conversion technologies also led to concerns about privacy and authentication. It thus becomes highly desired to be able to prevent one's voice from being improperly utilized with such voice conversion technologies. This is why we report in this paper the first known attempt to perform adversarial attack on voice conversion. We introduce human imperceptible noise into the utterances of a speaker whose voice is to be defended. Given these adversarial examples, voice conversion models cannot convert other utterances so as to sound like being produced by the defended speaker. Preliminary experiments were conducted on two currently state-of-the-art zero-shot voice conversion models. Objective and subjective evaluation results in both white-box and black-box scenarios are reported. It was shown that the speaker characteristics of the converted utterances were made obviously different from those of the defended speaker, while the adversarial examples of the defended speaker are not distinguishable from the authentic utterances.",

Cycle-consistent adversarial network-based VCs (CycleGAN-VC and CycleGAN-VC2) are widely accepted as benchmark methods. However, owing to their insufficient ability to grasp time-frequency structures, their application is limited to mel-cepstrum conversion and not mel-spectrogram conversion despite recent advances in mel-spectrogram vocoders. To overcome this, CycleGAN-VC3, an improved variant of CycleGAN-VC2 that incorporates an additional module called time-frequency adaptive normalization (TFAN), has been proposed. However, an increase in the number of learned parameters is imposed. As an alternative, we propose MaskCycleGAN-VC, which is another extension of CycleGAN-VC2 and is trained using a novel auxiliary task called filling in frames (FIF). With FIF, we apply a temporal mask to the input mel-spectrogram and encourage the converter to fill in missing frames based on surrounding frames. This task allows the converter to learn time-frequency structures in a self-supervised manner and eliminates the need for an additional module such as TFAN. A subjective evaluation of the naturalness and speaker similarity showed that MaskCycleGAN-VC outperformed both CycleGAN-VC2 and CycleGAN-VC3 with a model size similar to that of CycleGAN-VC2.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>",

Many VC systems use disentangle-based learning techniques to separate the speaker and the linguistic content information from a speech signal. Subsequently, they convert the voice by changing the speaker information to that of the target speaker. To prevent the speaker information from leaking into the content embeddings, previous works either reduce the dimension or quantize the content embedding as a strong information bottleneck. These mechanisms somehow hurt the synthesis quality. In this work, we propose AGAIN-VC, an innovative VC system using Activation Guidance and Adaptive Instance Normalization. AGAIN-VC is an auto-encoder-based model, comprising of a single encoder and a decoder.

Modern dialogue systems may consider adopting anthropomorphic personas, mimicking societal demographic groups to appear more approachable and trustworthy to users. However, the adoption of a persona can result in the adoption of biases. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study on persona biases in dialogue systems and conduct analyses on personas of different social classes, sexual orientations, races, and genders. We define persona biases as harmful differences in responses (e.g., varying levels of offensiveness, agreement with harmful statements) generated from adopting different demographic personas. Furthermore, we introduce an open-source framework, UnitPersonaBias, to explore and aggregate persona biases in dialogue systems. By analyzing the Blender and DialoGPT dialogue systems, we observe that adopting personas can actually decrease harmful responses, compared to not using any personas. Additionally, we find that persona choices can affect the degree of harms in generated responses and thus should be systematically evaluated before deployment. We also analyze how personas can result in different amounts of harm towards specific demographics.",

Automatic metrics such as BLEU correlate weakly with human annotations, resulting in a significant bias across different models and datasets.

Moreover, judges tend to evaluate a small number of dialogues, meaning that minor differences in evaluation configuration may lead to dissimilar results. In this paper, we present interpretable metrics for evaluating topic coherence by making use of distributed sentence representations. Furthermore, we introduce calculable approximations of human judgment based on conversational coherence by adopting state-of-the-art entailment techniques. Results show that our metrics can be used as a surrogate for human judgment, making it easy to evaluate dialogue systems on large-scale datasets and allowing an unbiased estimate for the quality of the responses.",

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) recently emerged as a new paradigm for object representation from multi-view (MV) images. Yet, it cannot handle multi-scale (MS) images and camera pose estimation errors, which generally is the case with multi-view images captured from a day-to-day commodity camera. Although recently proposed Mip-NeRF could handle multi-scale imaging problems with NeRF, it cannot handle camera pose estimation error. On the other hand, the newly proposed BARF can solve the camera pose problem with NeRF but fails if the images are multi-scale in nature. This paper presents a robust multi-scale neural radiance fields representation approach to simultaneously overcome both real-world imaging issues. Our method handles multi-scale imaging effects and camera-pose estimation problems with NeRF-inspired approaches by leveraging the fundamentals of scene rigidity. To reduce unpleasant aliasing artifacts due to multi-scale images in the ray space, we leverage Mip-NeRF multi-scale representation. For joint estimation of robust camera pose, we propose graph-neural network-based multiple motion averaging in the neural volume rendering framework. We demonstrate, with examples, that for an accurate neural representation of an object from day-to-day acquired multi-view images, it is crucial to have precise camera-pose estimates. Without considering robustness measures in the camera pose estimation, modeling for multi-scale aliasing artifacts via conical frustum can be counterproductive. We present extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our approach provides better results than the recent NeRF-inspired approaches for such realistic settings.",

        "content2": " dynamic neural radiance field nerf is a powerful algorithm capable of rendering photo-realistic novel view images from a monocular rgb video of a dynamic sceneAlthough it warps moving points across frames from the observation spaces to a common canonical space for rendering, dynamic NeRF does not model the change of the reflected color during the warping.As a result, this approach often fails drastically on challenging specular objects in motion.we address this limitation by reformulating the neural radiance field function to be conditioned on surface position and orientation in the observation spaceThis allows the specular surface at different poses to keep the different reflected colors when mapped to the common canonical space.Additionally, we add the mask of moving objects to guide the deformation field.the mask mitigates the problem of failure to find temporal correspondences with only rgb supervision as the specular surface changes color during motionWe evaluate our model based on the novel view synthesis quality with a self-collected dataset of different moving specular objects in realistic environments.experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the reconstruction quality of moving specular objects from monocular rgb videos compared to the existing nerf modelsOur code and data are available at the project website https://github.com/JokerYan/NeRF-DS.",

The latter can be evaluated from various points of view, such as recognition and understanding rates, dialogue naturalness and robustness against recognition errors. Evaluation usually requires compiling a large corpus of words and sentences uttered by users, relevant to the application domain the system is designed for. This paper proposes a new technique that makes it possible to reuse such a corpus for the evaluation and to check the performance of the system when different dialogue strategies are used. The technique is based on the automatic generation of conversations between the dialogue system, together with an additional dialogue system called user simulator that represents the user’s interaction with the dialogue system. The technique has been applied to evaluate a dialogue system developed in our lab using two different recognition front-ends and two different dialogue strategies to handle user confirmations. The experiments show that the prompt-dependent recognition front-end achieves better results, but that this front-end is appropriate only if users limit their utterances to those related to the current system prompt. The prompt-independent front-end achieves inferior results, but enables front-end users to utter any permitted utterance at any time, irrespective of the system prompt. In consequence, this front-end may allow a more natural and comfortable interaction. The experiments also show that the re-prompting confirmation strategy enhances system performance for both recognition front-ends.",

The alignment of phonetically equivalent source and target vectors is not problematic when the training corpus is parallel, which means that both speakers utter the same training sentences. However, in some practical situations, such as cross-lingual voice conversion, it is not possible to obtain such parallel utterances. With an aim towards increasing the versatility of current voice conversion systems, this paper proposes a new iterative alignment method that allows pairing phonetically equivalent acoustic vectors from nonparallel utterances from different speakers, even under cross-lingual conditions. This method is based on existing voice conversion techniques, and it does not require any phonetic or linguistic information. Subjective evaluation experiments show that the performance of the resulting voice conversion system is very similar to that of an equivalent system trained on a parallel corpus.",

At the conversion stage, acoustic features and durations of source utterances are converted simultaneously using the unified acoustic model. Mel-scale spectrograms are adopted as acoustic features, which contain both excitation and vocal tract descriptions of speech signals. The bottleneck features extracted from source speech using an automatic speech recognition model are appended as an auxiliary input. A WaveNet vocoder conditioned on Mel-spectrograms is built to reconstruct waveforms from the outputs of the SCENT model. It is worth noting that our proposed method can achieve appropriate duration conversion, which is difficult in conventional methods. Experimental results show that our proposed method obtained better objective and subjective performance than the baseline methods using Gaussian mixture models and deep neural networks as acoustic models.

We propose a framework to remove objects from a NeRF representation created from an RGB-D sequence. Our NeRF inpainting method leverages recent work in 2D image inpainting and is guided by a user-provided mask. Our algorithm is underpinned by a confidence based view selection procedure. It chooses which of the individual 2D inpainted images to use in the creation of the NeRF, so that the resulting inpainted NeRF is 3D consistent. We show that our method for NeRF editing is effective for synthesizing plausible inpaintings in a multi-view coherent manner, outperforming competing methods.

Then, joint state transition exploration and dialogue policy optimization are performed in batch. Value iteration method of reinforcement learning framework is employed to optimize the dialogue policy. Our approach is tested through interaction with user in a Chinese restricted domain dialogue system supporting to act as a mobile phone recommendation assistant.

The dialogue strategies were learnt in a simulated environment and tested in a laboratory setting with 32 users. These dialogues were used to evaluate three types of machine dialogue behaviour: hand-coded, fully-learnt and semi-learnt. These experiments also served to evaluate the realism of simulated dialogues using two proposed metrics contrasted with ‘Precision-Recall’. The learnt dialogue behaviours used the Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) model, and we report the first evaluation of this model in a realistic conversational environment. Experimental results in the travel planning domain provide evidence to support the following claims: (a) hierarchical semi-learnt dialogue agents are a better alternative (with higher overall performance) than deterministic or fully-learnt behaviour; (b) spoken dialogue strategies learnt with highly coherent user behaviour and conservative recognition error rates (keyword error rate of 20%) can outperform a reasonable hand-coded strategy; and (c) hierarchical reinforcement learning dialogue agents are feasible and promising for the (semi) automatic design of optimized dialogue behaviours in larger-scale systems.",

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieves impressive ren-dering performance by learning volumetric 3D representation from several images of different views. However, it is difficult to reconstruct a sharp NeRF from blurry input as often occurred in the wild. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Event-Enhanced NeRF (E2NeRF) by utilizing the combination data of a bio-inspired event camera and a standard RGB camera. To effectively introduce event stream into the learning process of neural volumetric representation, we propose a blur rendering loss and an event rendering loss, which guide the network via modelling real blur process and event generation process, respectively. Moreover, a camera pose estimation framework for real-world data is built with the guidance of event stream to generalize the method to practical applications. In contrast to previous image-based or event-based NeRF, our framework effectively utilizes the internal relationship between events and images. As a result, E2NeRF not only achieves image deblurring but also achieves high-quality novel view image generation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate that E2NeRF can effectively learn a sharp NeRF from blurry images, especially in complex and low-light scenes.

NeRFs have been shown to be remarkably effective for the task of view synthesis — synthesizing photorealistic novel views of real-world scenes or objects. In this work, we investigate whether we can apply analysis-by-synthesis via NeRF for mesh-free, RGB-only 6DoF pose estimation – given an image, find the translation and rotation of a camera relative to a 3D object or scene. Our method assumes that no object mesh models are available during either training or test time. Starting from an initial pose estimate, we use gradient descent to minimize the residual between pixels rendered from a NeRF and pixels in an observed image. In our experiments, we first study 1) how to sample rays during pose refinement for iNeRF to collect informative gradients and 2) how different batch sizes of rays affect iNeRF on a synthetic dataset. We then show that for complex real-world scenes from the LLFF dataset [21], iNeRF can improve NeRF by estimating the camera poses of novel images and using these images as additional training data for NeRF. Finally, we show iNeRF can perform categorylevel object pose estimation, including object instances not seen during training, with RGB images by inverting a NeRF model inferred from a single view.",

However, current approaches to NeRF-based models rely on clean images with accurate camera calibration, which can be difficult to obtain in the real world, where data is often subject to corruption and distortion. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the robustness of NeRF-based novel view synthesis algorithms in the presence of different types of corruptions.\n  We find that NeRF-based models are significantly degraded in the presence of corruption, and are more sensitive to a different set of corruptions than image recognition models. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of the feature encoder in generalizable methods, which synthesize images using neural features extracted via convolutional neural networks or transformers, and find that it only contributes marginally to robustness.

To overcome these limitations, we propose FENeRF, a 3D-aware generator that can produce view-consistent and locally-editable portrait images. Our method uses two decoupled latent codes to generate corresponding facial semantics and texture in a spatial-aligned 3D volume with shared geometry. Benefiting from such underlying 3D representation, FENeRF can jointly render the boundary-aligned image and semantic mask and use the semantic mask to edit the 3D volume via GAN inversion. We further show such 3D representation can be learned from widely available monocular image and semantic mask pairs. Moreover, we reveal that joint learning semantics and texture helps to generate finer geometry. Our experiments demonstrate that FENeRF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various face editing tasks.",

In this paper, we propose a modification of the conventional training process for VC that allows it to perform as an AC transform. Namely, we pair source and target vectors based not on their ordering within a parallel corpus, as is commonly done in VC, but based on their linguistic similarity. We validate the approach on a corpus containing native-accented and Spanish-accented utterances, and compare it against conventional VC through a series of listening tests.

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has gained considerable attention recently for 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis due to its remarkable synthesis quality. However, image blurriness caused by defocus or motion, which often occurs when capturing scenes in the wild, significantly degrades its reconstruction quality. To address this problem, We propose Deblur-NeRF, the first method that can recover a sharp NeRF from blurry input. We adopt an analysis-by-synthesis approach that reconstructs blurry views by simulating the blurring process, thus making NeRF robust to blurry inputs. The core of this simulation is a novel Deformable Sparse Kernel (DSK) module that models spatially-varying blur kernels by deforming a canonical sparse kernel at each spatial location. The ray origin of each kernel point is jointly optimized, inspired by the physical blurring process. This module is parameterized as an MLP that has the ability to be generalized to various blur types. Jointly optimizing the NeRF and the DSK module allows us to restore a sharp NeRF. We demonstrate that our method can be used on both camera motion blur and defocus blur: the two most common types of blur in real scenes. Evaluation results on both synthetic and real-world data show that our method outperforms several baselines. The synthetic and real datasets along with the source code can be find in https://limacv.github.io/deblurnerf/",

To improve the generalization to unseen faces, we train the MLP in the canonical coordinate space approximated by 3D face morphable models. We quantitatively evaluate the method using controlled captures and demonstrate the generalization to real portrait images, showing favorable results against state-of-the-arts.",

Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based conversion is commonly used, but it is subject to overfitting. In this paper, we propose to use partial least squares (PLS)-based transforms in voice conversion. To prevent overfitting, the degrees of freedom in the mapping can be controlled by choosing a suitable number of components. We propose a technique to combine PLS with GMMs, enabling the use of multiple local linear mappings. To further improve the perceptual quality of the mapping where rapid transitions between GMM components produce audible artefacts, we propose to low-pass filter the component posterior probabilities. The conducted experiments show that the proposed technique results in better subjective and objective quality than the baseline joint density GMM approach. In speech quality conversion preference tests, the proposed method achieved 67% preference score against the smoothed joint density GMM method and 84% preference score against the unsmoothed joint density GMM method. In objective tests the proposed method produced a lower Mel-cepstral distortion than the reference methods.",

However, there is still a large gap between the real target and converted speech, and bridging this gap remains a challenge. To reduce the gap, we propose CycleGAN-VC2, which is an improved version of CycleGAN-VC incorporating three new techniques: an improved objective (two-step adversarial losses), improved generator (2-1-2D CNN), and improved discriminator (PatchGAN). We evaluated our method on a non-parallel VC task and analyzed the effect of each technique in detail. An objective evaluation showed that these techniques help bring the converted feature sequence closer to the target in terms of both global and local structures, which we assess by using Mel-cepstral distortion and modulation spectra distance, respectively.

Specifically, we design a novel two-pathway architecture, in which the scene branch encodes the scene geometry and appearance, and the object branch encodes each standalone object conditioned on learnable object activation codes. To survive the training in heavily cluttered scenes, we propose a scene-guided training strategy to solve the 3D space ambiguity in the occluded regions and learn sharp boundaries for each object.

However, leveraging multiple sequences captured by different cameras at different times is essential for better reconstruction performance. Multi-sequence data takes two main challenges: appearance variation due to different lighting conditions and non-static objects like pedestrians. To address these issues, we propose NeRF-MS, a novel approach to training NeRF with multi-sequence data. Specifically, we utilize a triplet loss to regularize the distribution of per-image appearance code, which leads to better high-frequency texture and consistent appearance, such as specular reflections. Then, we explicitly model non-static objects to reduce floaters. Extensive results demonstrate that NeRF-MS not only outperforms state-of-the-art view synthesis methods on outdoor and synthetic scenes, but also achieves 3D consistent rendering and robust appearance controlling.

Our approach exploits multi-view geometry constraints in order to jointly learn the NeRF and refine the camera poses. By relying on pixel matches extracted between the input views, our multi-view correspondence objective enforces the optimized scene and camera poses to converge to a global and geometrically accurate solution. Our depth consistency loss further encourages the reconstructed scene to be consistent from any viewpoint.

The idea is to bridge between speakers by means of Phonetic PosteriorGrams (PPGs) obtained from a speaker-independent automatic speech recognition (SI-ASR) system. It is assumed that these PPGs can represent articulation of speech sounds in a speaker-normalized space and correspond to spoken content speaker-independently. The proposed approach first obtains PPGs of target speech. Then, a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Recurrent Neural Network (DBLSTM) structure is used to model the relationships between the PPGs and acoustic features of the target speech. To convert arbitrary source speech, we obtain its PPGs from the same SI-ASR and feed them into the trained DBLSTM for generating converted speech. Our approach has two main advantages: 1) no parallel training data is required; 2) a trained model can be applied to any other source speaker for a fixed target speaker (i.e., many-to-one conversion). Experiments show that our approach performs equally well or better than state-of-the-art systems in both speech quality and speaker similarity.",

        "content1": "In this paper, we present statistical approaches to enhance body-conducted unvoiced speech for silent speech communication. A body-conductive microphone called nonaudible murmur (NAM) microphone is effectively used to detect very soft unvoiced speech such as NAM or a whispered voice while keeping speech sounds emitted outside almost inaudible. However, body-conducted unvoiced speech is difficult to use in human-to-human speech communication because it sounds unnatural and less intelligible owing to the acoustic change caused by body conduction. To address this issue, voice conversion (VC) methods from NAM to normal speech (NAM-to-Speech) and to a whispered voice (NAM-to-Whisper) are proposed, where the acoustic features of body-conducted unvoiced speech are converted into those of natural voices in a probabilistic manner using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Moreover, these methods are extended to convert not only NAM but also a body-conducted whispered voice (BCW) as another type of body-conducted unvoiced speech. Several experimental evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The experimental results show that 1) NAM-to-Speech effectively improves intelligibility but it causes degradation of naturalness owing to the difficulty of estimating natural fundamental frequency contours from unvoiced speech; 2) NAM-to-Whisper significantly outperforms NAM-to-Speech in terms of both intelligibility and naturalness; and 3) a single conversion model capable of converting both NAM and BCW is effectively developed in our proposed VC methods.",

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have attracted significant attention due to their ability to synthesize novel scene views with great accuracy. However, inherent to their underlying formulation, the sampling of points along a ray with zero width may result in ambiguous representations that lead to further rendering artifacts such as aliasing in the final scene. To address this issue, the recent variant mip-NeRF proposes an Integrated Positional Encoding (IPE) based on a conical view frustum. Although this is expressed with an integral formulation, mip-NeRF instead approximates this integral as the expected value of a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This approximation is reliable for short frustums but degrades with highly elongated regions, which arises when dealing with distant scene objects under a larger depth of field. In this paper, we explore the use of an exact approach for calculating the IPE by using a pyramid-based integral formulation instead of an approximated conical-based one. We denote this formulation as Exact-NeRF and contribute the first approach to offer a precise analytical solution to the IPE within the NeRF domain. Our exploratory work illustrates that such an exact formulation (Exact-NeRF) matches the accuracy of mip-NeRF and furthermore provides a natural extension to more challenging scenarios without further modification, such as in the case of unbounded scenes. Our contribution aims to both address the hitherto unexplored issues of frustum approximation in earlier NeRF work and additionally provide insight into the potential future consideration of analytical solutions in future NeRF extensions.",

        "content1": "Recently, voice conversion (VC) without parallel data has been successfully adapted to multi-target scenario in which a single model is trained to convert the input voice to many different speakers. However, such model suffers from the limitation that it can only convert the voice to the speakers in the training data, which narrows down the applicable scenario of VC. In this paper, we proposed a novel one-shot VC approach which is able to perform VC by only an example utterance from source and target speaker respectively, and the source and target speaker do not even need to be seen during training. This is achieved by disentangling speaker and content representations with instance normalization (IN). Objective and subjective evaluation shows that our model is able to generate the voice similar to target speaker. In addition to the performance measurement, we also demonstrate that this model is able to learn meaningful speaker representations without any supervision.",

Existing works resort to neural language models for dialogue embedding and neglect the explicit logical reasoning, leading to poor explainable and generalization ability. In this work, we propose an explainable Heterogeneous Graph Reasoning (HGR) model to unify the relational dialogue context understanding and entity-correlation reasoning into a heterogeneous graph structure. HGR encodes entity context according to the corresponding utterance and deduces next response after fusing the underlying medical knowledge with entity context by attentional graph propagation. To push forward the future research on expert-sensitive task-oriented dialogue system, we first release a large-scale Medical Dialogue Consultant benchmark (MDG-C) with 16 Gastrointestinal diseases for evaluating consultant capability and a Medical Dialogue Diagnosis benchmark (MDG-D) with 6 diseases for measuring diagnosis capability of models, respectively. Extensive experiments on both MDG-C and MDG-D benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our HGR over state-of-the-art knowledge grounded approaches in general fields of medical dialogue system.",

The proposed system is built on a mapping function between source and target spectral envelopes followed by a frame selection algorithm to produce final spectral envelopes. Converted speech is produced by a basic LP analysis of the source and LP synthesis using the converted spectral envelopes. We compared three types of conversion: without mapping, with mapping and using the excitation of the source speaker and finally with mapping using the excitation of the target. Results show that the combination of mapping and frame selection provide the best results, and underline the interest to work on methods to convert the LP excitation.",

        "content1": "Thin, reflective objects such as forks and whisks are common in our daily lives, but they are particularly chal-lenging for robot perception because it is hard to reconstruct them using commodity RGB-D cameras or multi-view stereo techniques. While traditional pipelines struggle with objects like these, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have recently been shown to be remarkably effective for performing view synthesis on objects with thin structures or reflective materials. In this paper we explore the use of NeRF as a new source of supervision for robust robot vision systems. In particular, we demonstrate that a NeRF representation of a scene can be used to train dense object descriptors. We use an optimized NeRF to extract dense correspondences between multiple views of an object, and then use these correspondences as training data for learning a view-invariant representation of the object. NeRF's usage of a density field allows us to reformulate the correspondence problem with a novel distribution-of-depths formulation, as opposed to the conventional approach of using a depth map. Dense correspondence models supervised with our method significantly outperform off-the-shelf learned descriptors by 106% (PCK@3px metric, more than doubling performance) and outperform our baseline supervised with multi-view stereo by 29%. Furthermore, we demonstrate the learned dense descriptors enable robots to perform accurate 6-degree of freedom (6-DoF) pick and place of thin and reflective objects.",

        "content1": "Tremendous progress in deep generative models has led to photorealistic image synthesis. While achieving compelling results, most approaches operate in the two-dimensional image domain, ignoring the three-dimensional nature of our world. Several recent works therefore propose generative models which are 3D-aware, i.e., scenes are modeled in 3D and then rendered differentiably to the image plane. While this leads to impressive 3D consistency, the camera needs to be modelled as well and we show in this work that these methods are sensitive to the choice of prior camera distributions. Current approaches assume fixed intrinsics and predefined priors over camera pose ranges, and parameter tuning is typically required for real-world data. If the data distribution is not matched, results degrade significantly. Our key hypothesis is that learning a camera generator jointly with the image generator leads to a more principled approach to 3D-aware image synthesis. Further, we propose to decompose the scene into a background and foreground model, leading to more efficient and disentangled scene representations. While training from raw, unposed image collections, we learn a 3D- and camera-aware generative model which faithfully recovers not only the image but also the camera data distribution. At test time, our model generates images with explicit control over the camera as well as the shape and appearance of the scene.",

Unlike previous approaches that either lack sufficient geometry deformations and texture details or require meshes to guide the stylization, our method can shift a 3D scene to the target style characterized by desired geometry and appearance variations without any mesh guidance. This is achieved by introducing a novel global-local contrastive learning strategy, combined with the directional constraint to simultaneously control both the trajectory and the strength of the target style. Moreover, we adopt a weight regularization method to effectively suppress cloudy artifacts and geometry noises which arise easily when the density field is transformed during geometry stylization. Through extensive experiments on various styles, we demonstrate that our method is effective and robust regarding both single-view stylization quality and cross-view consistency.

In this paper, we demonstrate that real-time rendering is possible by utilizing thousands of tiny MLPs instead of one single large MLP. In our setting, each individual MLP only needs to represent parts of the scene, thus smaller and faster-to-evaluate MLPs can be used. By combining this divide-and-conquer strategy with further optimizations, rendering is accelerated by three orders of magnitude compared to the original NeRF model without incurring high storage costs. Further, using teacher-student distillation for training, we show that this speed-up can be achieved without sacrificing visual quality.",

        "content1": "This paper describes a statistically motivated framework for performing real-time dialogue state updates and policy learning in a spoken dialogue system. The framework is based on the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which provides a well-founded, statistical model of spoken dialogue management. However, exact belief state updates in a POMDP model are computationally intractable so approximate methods must be used. This paper presents a tractable method based on the loopy belief propagation algorithm. Various simplifications are made, which improve the efficiency significantly compared to the original algorithm as well as compared to other POMDP-based dialogue state updating approaches. A second contribution of this paper is a method for learning in spoken dialogue systems which uses a component-based policy with the episodic Natural Actor Critic algorithm.\nThe framework proposed in this paper was tested on both simulations and in a user trial. Both indicated that using Bayesian updates of the dialogue state significantly outperforms traditional definitions of the dialogue state. Policy learning worked effectively and the learned policy outperformed all others on simulations. In user trials the learned policy was also competitive, although its optimality was less conclusive. Overall, the Bayesian update of dialogue state framework was shown to be a feasible and effective approach to building real-world POMDP-based dialogue systems.",

        "content1": "Voice conversion methods based on frequency warping followed by amplitude scaling have been recently proposed. These methods modify the frequency axis of the source spectrum in such manner that some significant parts of it, usually the formants, are moved towards their image in the target speaker's spectrum. Amplitude scaling is then applied to compensate for the differences between warped source spectra and target spectra. This article presents a fully parametric formulation of a frequency warping plus amplitude scaling method in which bilinear frequency warping functions are used. Introducing this constraint allows for the conversion error to be described in the cepstral domain and to minimize it with respect to the parameters of the transformation through an iterative algorithm, even when multiple overlapping conversion classes are considered. The paper explores the advantages and limitations of this approach when applied to a cepstral representation of speech. We show that it achieves significant improvements in quality with respect to traditional methods based on Gaussian mixture models, with no loss in average conversion accuracy. Despite its relative simplicity, it achieves similar performance scores to state-of-the-art statistical methods involving dynamic features and global variance.",

This is in large part due to the rapidly growing market demand for dialogue agents capable of goal-oriented behaviour. Due to the business process nature of these conversations, end-to-end machine learning systems are generally not a viable option, as the generated dialogue agents must be deployable and verifiable on behalf of the businesses authoring them.\n  In this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the creation of goal-oriented complex dialogue systems that dramatically eliminates the need for a designer to manually specify a dialogue tree, which nearly all current systems have to resort to when the interaction pattern falls outside standard patterns such as slot filling. We propose a declarative representation of the dialogue agent to be processed by state-of-the-art planning technology. Our proposed approach covers all aspects of the process; from model solicitation to the execution of the generated plans/dialogue agents. Along the way, we introduce novel planning encodings for declarative dialogue synthesis, a variety of interfaces for working with the specification as a dialogue architect, and a robust executor for generalized contingent plans. We have created prototype implementations of all components, and in this paper, we further demonstrate the resulting system empirically.",

Modern dialogue systems may consider adopting anthropomorphic personas, mimicking societal demographic groups to appear more approachable and trustworthy to users. However, the adoption of a persona can result in the adoption of biases. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study on persona biases in dialogue systems and conduct analyses on personas of different social classes, sexual orientations, races, and genders. We define persona biases as harmful differences in responses (e.g., varying levels of offensiveness, agreement with harmful statements) generated from adopting different demographic personas. Furthermore, we introduce an open-source framework, UnitPersonaBias, to explore and aggregate persona biases in dialogue systems. By analyzing the Blender and DialoGPT dialogue systems, we observe that adopting personas can actually decrease harmful responses, compared to not using any personas. Additionally, we find that persona choices can affect the degree of harms in generated responses and thus should be systematically evaluated before deployment. We also analyze how personas can result in different amounts of harm towards specific demographics.",

Joint estimation of source and target HMMs is exploited for spectrum conversion from neutral to expressive speech. Gamma distribution is embedded as the duration model for each state in source and target HMMs. The expressive style-dependent decision trees achieve prosodic conversion. The STRAIGHT algorithm is adopted for the analysis and synthesis process. A set of small-sized speech databases for each expressive style is designed and collected to train the DeBi-HMM voice conversion models. Several experiments with statistical hypothesis testing are conducted to evaluate the quality of synthetic speech as perceived by human subjects.

EVC methods without duration mapping generate emotional speech with identical duration to that of the neutral input speech. In reality, even the same sentences would have different speeds and rhythms depending on the emotions. To solve this, the proposed method adopts a sequence-to-sequence network with an attention module that enables the network to learn attention in the neutral input sequence should be focused on which part of the emotional output sequence. Besides, to capture the multi-attribute aspects of emotional variations, an emotion encoder is designed for transforming acoustic features into emotion embedding vectors. By aggregating the emotion embedding vectors for each emotion, a representative vector for the target emotion is obtained and weighted to reflect emotion strength. By introducing a speaker encoder, the proposed method can preserve speaker identity even after the emotion conversion. Objective and subjective evaluation results confirm that the proposed method is superior to other previous works. Especially, in emotion strength control, we achieve in getting successful results.",

        "content1": "This paper presents a new spectral envelope conversion method using deep neural networks (DNNs). The conventional joint density Gaussian mixture model (JDGMM) based spectral conversion methods perform stably and effectively. However, the speech generated by these methods suffer severe quality degradation due to the following two factors: 1) inadequacy of JDGMM in modeling the distribution of spectral features as well as the non-linear mapping relationship between the source and target speakers, 2) spectral detail loss caused by the use of high-level spectral features such as mel-cepstra. Previously, we have proposed to use the mixture of restricted Boltzmann machines (MoRBM) and the mixture of Gaussian bidirectional associative memories (MoGBAM) to cope with these problems. In this paper, we propose to use a DNN to construct a global non-linear mapping relationship between the spectral envelopes of two speakers. The proposed DNN is generatively trained by cascading two RBMs, which model the distributions of spectral envelopes of source and target speakers respectively, using a Bernoulli BAM (BBAM). Therefore, the proposed training method takes the advantage of the strong modeling ability of RBMs in modeling the distribution of spectral envelopes and the superiority of BAMs in deriving the conditional distributions for conversion. Careful comparisons and analysis among the proposed method and some conventional methods are presented in this paper. The subjective results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance in terms of both similarity and naturalness compared to conventional methods.",

Most approaches assume optimal illumination and slow camera motion. These assumptions are often violated in robotic applications, where images may contain motion blur, and the scene may not have suitable illumination. This can cause significant problems for downstream tasks such as navigation, inspection, or visualization of the scene. To alleviate these problems, we present E-NeRF, the first method which estimates a volumetric scene representation in the form of a NeRF from a fast-moving event camera. Our method can recover NeRFs during very fast motion and in high-dynamic-range conditions where frame-based approaches fail. We show that rendering high-quality frames is possible by only providing an event stream as input. Furthermore, by combining events and frames, we can estimate NeRFs of higher quality than state-of-the-art approaches under severe motion blur. We also show that combining events and frames can overcome failure cases of NeRF estimation in scenarios where only a few input views are available without requiring additional regularization.",

Unlike prior works on neural radiance fields that consider per-scene optimization on densely captured images, we propose a generic deep neural network that can reconstruct radiance fields from only three nearby input views via fast network inference. Our approach leverages plane-swept cost volumes (widely used in multi-view stereo) for geometry-aware scene reasoning, and combines this with physically based volume rendering for neural radiance field reconstruction. We train our network on real objects in the DTU dataset, and test it on three different datasets to evaluate its effectiveness and generalizability. Our approach can generalize across scenes (even indoor scenes, completely different from our training scenes of objects) and generate realistic view synthesis results using only three input images, significantly outperforming concurrent works on generalizable radiance field reconstruction. Moreover, if dense images are captured, our estimated radiance field representation can be easily fine-tuned; this leads to fast per-scene reconstruction with higher rendering quality and substantially less optimization time than NeRF.",

Our approach focuses on preserving voice content and depends on the generative network to learn voice style. We first train a multi-speaker SampleRNN model conditioned on linguistic features, pitch contour, and speaker identity using a multi-speaker speech corpus. Voice-converted speech is generated using linguistic features and pitch contour extracted from the source speaker, and the target speaker identity. We demonstrate that our system is capable of many-to-many voice conversion without requiring parallel data, enabling broad applications.

        "content2": "Purely MLP-based neural radiance fields (NeRF-based methods) often suffer from underfitting with blurred renderings on large-scale scenes due to limited model capacity. Recent approaches propose to geographically divide the scene and adopt multiple sub-NeRFs to model each region individually, leading to linear scale-up in training costs and the number of sub-NeRFs as the scene expands. An alternative solution is to use a feature grid representation, which is computationally efficient and can naturally scale to a large scene with increased grid resolutions. However, the feature grid tends to be less constrained and often reaches suboptimal solutions, producing noisy artifacts in renderings, especially in regions with complex geometry and texture. In this work, we present a new framework that realizes high-fidelity rendering on large urban scenes while being computationally efficient. We propose to use a compact multi-resolution ground feature plane representation to coarsely capture the scene, and complement it with positional encoding inputs through another NeRF branch for rendering in a joint learning fashion. We show that such an integration can utilize the advantages of two alternative solutions: a light-weighted NeRF is sufficient, under the guidance of the feature grid representation, to render photorealistic novel views with fine details; and the jointly optimized ground feature planes, can meanwhile gain further refinements, forming a more accurate and compact feature space and output much more natural rendering results.",

However, in downstream applications where decisions need to be made based on automatic predictions, it is critical to leverage the confidence associated with the model estimations. Whereas uncertainty quantification is a long-standing problem in Machine Learning, it has been largely overlooked in the recent NeRF literature. In this context, we propose Stochastic Neural Radiance Fields (S-NeRF), a generalization of standard NeRF that learns a probability distribution over all the possible radiance fields modeling the scene. This distribution allows to quantify the uncertainty associated with the scene information provided by the model. S-NeRF optimization is posed as a Bayesian learning problem that is efficiently addressed using the Variational Inference framework. Exhaustive experiments over benchmark datasets demonstrate that S-NeRF is able to provide more reliable predictions and confidence values than generic approaches previously proposed for uncertainty estimation in other domains.",

Summary state and action spaces lead to good performance but require pre-engineering effort, RL knowledge, and domain expertise. In order to remove the need to define such summary spaces, we show that deep RL can also be trained efficiently on the original state and action spaces. Dialogue systems based on partially observable Markov decision processes are known to require many dialogues to train, which makes them unappealing for practical deployment. We show that a deep RL method based on an actor-critic architecture can exploit a small amount of data very efficiently. Indeed, with only a few hundred dialogues collected with a handcrafted policy, the actor-critic deep learner is considerably bootstrapped from a combination of supervised and batch RL. In addition, convergence to an optimal policy is significantly sped up compared to other deep RL methods initialized on the data with batch RL.

The current state of affairs suggests various evaluation protocols to assess chat-oriented dialogue management systems, rendering it difficult to conduct fair comparative studies across different approaches and gain an insightful understanding of their values. To foster this research, a more robust evaluation protocol must be set in place. This paper presents a comprehensive synthesis of both automated and human evaluation methods on dialogue systems, identifying their shortcomings while accumulating evidence towards the most effective evaluation dimensions. A total of 20 papers from the last two years are surveyed to analyze three types of evaluation protocols: automated, static, and interactive. Finally, the evaluation dimensions used in these papers are compared against our expert evaluation on the system-user dialogue data collected from the Alexa Prize 2020.",

        "content1": "This paper proposes an any-to-many location-relative, sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq), non-parallel voice conversion approach, which utilizes text supervision during training. In this approach, we combine a bottle-neck feature extractor (BNE) with a seq2seq synthesis module. During the training stage, an encoder-decoder-based hybrid connectionist-temporal-classification-attention (CTC-attention) phoneme recognizer is trained, whose encoder has a bottle-neck layer. A BNE is obtained from the phoneme recognizer and is utilized to extract speaker-independent, dense and rich spoken content representations from spectral features. Then a multi-speaker location-relative attention based seq2seq synthesis model is trained to reconstruct spectral features from the bottle-neck features, conditioning on speaker representations for speaker identity control in the generated speech. To mitigate the difficulties of using seq2seq models to align long sequences, we down-sample the input spectral feature along the temporal dimension and equip the synthesis model with a discretized mixture of logistic (MoL) attention mechanism. Since the phoneme recognizer is trained with large speech recognition data corpus, the proposed approach can conduct any-to-many voice conversion. Objective and subjective evaluations show that the proposed any-to-many approach has superior voice conversion performance in terms of both naturalness and speaker similarity. Ablation studies are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of feature selection and model design strategies in the proposed approach. The proposed VC approach can readily be extended to support any-to-any VC (also known as one/few-shot VC), and achieve high performance according to objective and subjective evaluations.",

        "content1": "We present a novel voice conversion (VC) framework by learning from a text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis system, that is called TTS-VC transfer learning or TTL-VC for short. We first develop a multi-speaker speech synthesis system with sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder extracts the linguistic representations of input text, while the decoder, conditioned on target speaker embedding, takes the context vectors and the attention recurrent network cell output to generate target acoustic features. We take advantage of the fact that TTS system maps input text to speaker independent context vectors, thus re-purpose such a mapping to supervise the training of the latent representations of an encoder-decoder voice conversion system. In the voice conversion system, the encoder takes speech instead of text as the input, while the decoder is functionally similar to the TTS decoder. As we condition the decoder on a speaker embedding, the system can be trained on non-parallel data for any-to-any voice conversion. During voice conversion training, we present both text and speech to speech synthesis and voice conversion networks respectively. At run-time, the voice conversion network uses its own encoder-decoder architecture without the need of text input. Experiments show that the proposed TTL-VC system outperforms two competitive voice conversion baselines consistently, namely phonetic posteriorgram and AutoVC methods, in terms of speech quality, naturalness, and speaker similarity.",

The proposed method is particularly noteworthy in that it is general purpose and high quality and works without any extra data, modules, or alignment procedure. Our method, called CycleGAN-VC, uses a cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) with gated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and an identity-mapping loss. A CycleGAN learns forward and inverse mappings simultaneously using adversarial and cycle-consistency losses. This makes it possible to find an optimal pseudo pair from non-parallel data. Furthermore, the adversarial loss can bring the converted speech close to the target one on the basis of indistinguishability without explicit density estimation. This allows to avoid over-smoothing caused by statistical averaging, which occurs in many conventional statistical model-based VC methods that represent data distribution explicitly. We configure a CycleGAN with gated CNNs and train it with an identity-mapping loss. This allows the mapping function to capture sequential and hierarchical structures while preserving linguistic information. We evaluated our method on a non-parallel VC task. An objective evaluation showed that the converted feature sequence was near natural in terms of global variance and modulation spectra, which are structural indicators highly correlated with subjective evaluation. A subjective evaluation showed that the quality of the converted speech was comparable to that obtained with a Gaussian mixture model-based parallel VC method even though CycleGAN-VC is trained under disadvantageous conditions (non-parallel and half the amount of data).",

We propose to disentangle the speaker style from linguistic content and encode the speaker style into a style embedding in a continuous space that forms the prototype of emotion embedding. We further learn the actual emotion encoder from an emotion-labelled database and study the use of relative attributes to represent fine-grained emotion intensity.

Automatic metrics such as BLEU correlate weakly with human annotations, resulting in a significant bias across different models and datasets. Some researchers resort to human judgment experimentation for assessing response quality, which is expensive, time consuming, and not scalable. Moreover, judges tend to evaluate a small number of dialogues, meaning that minor differences in evaluation configuration may lead to dissimilar results. In this paper, we present interpretable metrics for evaluating topic coherence by making use of distributed sentence representations. Furthermore, we introduce calculable approximations of human judgment based on conversational coherence by adopting state-of-the-art entailment techniques. Results show that our metrics can be used as a surrogate for human judgment, making it easy to evaluate dialogue systems on large-scale datasets and allowing an unbiased estimate for the quality of the responses.",

In this paper, we propose the General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) based model for voice conversion. It is a single pass learning network that makes the training procedure fast and comparatively less time consuming. The proposed system uses the shape of the vocal tract, the shape of the glottal pulse (excitation signal) and long term prosodic features to carry out the voice conversion task. In this paper, the shape of the vocal tract and the shape of source excitation of a particular speaker are represented using Line Spectral Frequencies (LSFs) and Linear Prediction (LP) residual respectively. GRNN is used to obtain the mapping function between the source and target speakers. The direct transformation of the time domain residual using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) causes phase change and generates artifacts in consecutive frames. In order to alleviate it, wavelet packet decomposed coefficients are used to characterize the excitation of the speech signal. The long term prosodic parameters namely, pitch contour (intonation) and the energy profile of the test signal are also modified in relation to that of the target (desired) speaker using the baseline method. The relative performances of the proposed model are compared to voice conversion system based on the state of the art RBF and GMM models using objective and subjective evaluation measures.

Our idea is to explicitly exploit the unequal contribution of spatial regions to guide talking portrait modeling. Specifically, to improve the accuracy of dynamic head reconstruction, a compact and expressive NeRF-based Tri-Plane Hash Representation is introduced by pruning empty spatial regions with three planar hash encoders. For speech audio, we propose a Region Attention Module to generate region-aware condition feature via an attention mechanism. Different from existing methods that utilize an MLP-based encoder to learn the cross-modal relation implicitly, the attention mechanism builds an explicit connection between audio features and spatial regions to capture the priors of local motions. Moreover, a direct and fast Adaptive Pose Encoding is introduced to optimize the head-torso separation problem by mapping the complex transformation of the head pose into spatial coordinates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method renders better high-fidelity and audio-lips synchronized talking portrait videos, with realistic details and high efficiency compared to previous methods.",

        "content1": "Any modification applied to speech signals has an impact on their perceptual quality. In particular, voice conversion to modify a source voice so that it is perceived as a specific target voice involves prosodic and spectral transformations that produce significant quality degradation. Choosing among the current voice conversion methods represents a trade-off between the similarity of the converted voice to the target voice and the quality of the resulting converted speech, both rated by listeners. This paper presents a new voice conversion method termed Weighted Frequency Warping that has a good balance between similarity and quality. This method uses a time-varying piecewise-linear frequency warping function and an energy correction filter, and it combines typical probabilistic techniques and frequency warping transformations. Compared to standard probabilistic systems, Weighted Frequency Warping results in a significant increase in quality scores, whereas the conversion scores remain almost unaltered. This paper carefully discusses the theoretical aspects of the method and the details of its implementation, and the results of an international evaluation of the new system are also included.",
        "content2": "We present a deep learning method for singing voice conversion. The proposed network is not conditioned on the text or on the notes, and it directly converts the audio of one singer to the voice of another. Training is performed without any form of supervision: no lyrics or any kind of phonetic features, no notes, and no matching samples between singers. The proposed network employs a single CNN encoder for all singers, a single WaveNet decoder, and a classifier that enforces the latent representation to be singer-agnostic. Each singer is represented by one embedding vector, which the decoder is conditioned on. In order to deal with relatively small datasets, we propose a new data augmentation scheme, as well as new training losses and protocols that are based on backtranslation. Our evaluation presents evidence that the conversion produces natural signing voices that are highly recognizable as the target singer.",

A main limitation of conventional NeRFs is that they often fail to produce high-quality renderings under novel viewpoints that are significantly different from the training viewpoints. In this paper, instead of exploiting few-shot image synthesis, we study the novel view extrapolation setting that (1) the training images can well describe an object, and (2) there is a notable discrepancy between the training and test viewpoints' distributions. We present RapNeRF (RAy Priors) as a solution. Our insight is that the inherent appearances of a 3D surface's arbitrary visible projections should be consistent. We thus propose a random ray casting policy that allows training unseen views using seen views. Furthermore, we show that a ray atlas pre-computed from the observed rays' viewing directions could further enhance the rendering quality for extrapolated views. A main limitation is that RapNeRF would remove the strong view-dependent effects because it leverages the multi-view consistency property.",

Unlike previous approaches that either lack sufficient geometry deformations and texture details or require meshes to guide the stylization, our method can shift a 3D scene to the target style characterized by desired geometry and appearance variations without any mesh guidance. This is achieved by introducing a novel global-local contrastive learning strategy, combined with the directional constraint to simultaneously control both the trajectory and the strength of the target style. Moreover, we adopt a weight regularization method to effectively suppress cloudy artifacts and geometry noises which arise easily when the density field is transformed during geometry stylization. Through extensive experiments on various styles, we demonstrate that our method is effective and robust regarding both single-view stylization quality and cross-view consistency.

        "content1": "To overcome the limitations of automated metrics (e.g. BLEU, METEOR) for evaluating dialogue systems, researchers typically use human judgments to provide convergent evidence. While it has been demonstrated that human judgments can suffer from the inconsistency of ratings, extant research has also found that the design of the evaluation task affects the consistency and quality of human judgments. We conduct a between-subjects study to understand the impact of four experiment conditions on human ratings of dialogue system output. In addition to discrete and continuous scale ratings, we also experiment with a novel application of Best-Worst scaling to dialogue evaluation. Through our systematic study with 40 crowdsourced workers in each task, we find that using continuous scales achieves more consistent ratings than Likert scale or ranking-based experiment design. Additionally, we find that factors such as time taken to complete the task and no prior experience of participating in similar studies of rating dialogue system output positively impact consistency and agreement amongst raters",

The learnt dialogue behaviours used the Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) model, and we report the first evaluation of this model in a realistic conversational environment. Experimental results in the travel planning domain provide evidence to support the following claims: (a) hierarchical semi-learnt dialogue agents are a better alternative (with higher overall performance) than deterministic or fully-learnt behaviour; (b) spoken dialogue strategies learnt with highly coherent user behaviour and conservative recognition error rates (keyword error rate of 20%) can outperform a reasonable hand-coded strategy; and (c) hierarchical reinforcement learning dialogue agents are feasible and promising for the (semi) automatic design of optimized dialogue behaviours in larger-scale systems.",

However, leveraging multiple sequences captured by different cameras at different times is essential for better reconstruction performance. Multi-sequence data takes two main challenges: appearance variation due to different lighting conditions and non-static objects like pedestrians. To address these issues, we propose NeRF-MS, a novel approach to training NeRF with multi-sequence data. Specifically, we utilize a triplet loss to regularize the distribution of per-image appearance code, which leads to better high-frequency texture and consistent appearance, such as specular reflections. Then, we explicitly model non-static objects to reduce floaters. Extensive results demonstrate that NeRF-MS not only outperforms state-of-the-art view synthesis methods on outdoor and synthetic scenes, but also achieves 3D consistent rendering and robust appearance controlling.

With the modeling power of DoubleField and the view-to-view transformer, our method significantly improves the reconstruction quality of both geometry and appearance, while supporting direct inference, scene-specific high-resolution finetuning, and fast rendering. The efficacy of DoubleField is validated by the quantitative evaluations on several datasets and the qualitative results in a real-world sparse multi-view system, showing its superior capability for high-quality human model reconstruction and photo-realistic free-viewpoint human rendering.

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has become a popular framework for learning implicit 3D representations and addressing different tasks such as novel-view synthesis or depth-map estimation. However, in downstream applications where decisions need to be made based on automatic predictions, it is critical to leverage the confidence associated with the model estimations. Whereas uncertainty quantification is a long-standing problem in Machine Learning, it has been largely overlooked in the recent NeRF literature. In this context, we propose Stochastic Neural Radiance Fields (S-NeRF), a generalization of standard NeRF that learns a probability distribution over all the possible radiance fields modeling the scene. This distribution allows to quantify the uncertainty associated with the scene information provided by the model. S-NeRF optimization is posed as a Bayesian learning problem that is efficiently addressed using the Variational Inference framework. Exhaustive experiments over benchmark datasets demonstrate that S-NeRF is able to provide more reliable predictions and confidence values than generic approaches previously proposed for uncertainty estimation in other domains.",

For this reason, VC is generally ill-suited for accent-conversion (AC) purposes, where the goal is to capture the regional accent of the source while preserving the voice quality of the target. In this paper, we propose a modification of the conventional training process for VC that allows it to perform as an AC transform. Namely, we pair source and target vectors based not on their ordering within a parallel corpus, as is commonly done in VC, but based on their linguistic similarity. We validate the approach on a corpus containing native-accented and Spanish-accented utterances, and compare it against conventional VC through a series of listening tests. We also analyze whether phonological differences between the two languages (Spanish and American English) help predict the performance of the two methods.",

To establish the level of human performance as a baseline, we first measure the ability of listeners to discriminate between original speech utterances under three conditions: normal, fundamental frequency and duration normalized, and LPC coded. Additionally, the spectral parameter conversion function is tested in isolation by listening to source, target, and converted speakers as LPC coded speech. The results show that the speaker identity of speech whose LPC spectrum has been converted can be recognized as the target speaker with the same level of performance as discriminating between LPC coded speech. However, the level of discrimination of converted utterances produced by the full VC system is significantly below that of speaker discrimination of natural speech.",

        "content1": "In this paper, we present statistical approaches to enhance body-conducted unvoiced speech for silent speech communication. A body-conductive microphone called nonaudible murmur (NAM) microphone is effectively used to detect very soft unvoiced speech such as NAM or a whispered voice while keeping speech sounds emitted outside almost inaudible. However, body-conducted unvoiced speech is difficult to use in human-to-human speech communication because it sounds unnatural and less intelligible owing to the acoustic change caused by body conduction. To address this issue, voice conversion (VC) methods from NAM to normal speech (NAM-to-Speech) and to a whispered voice (NAM-to-Whisper) are proposed, where the acoustic features of body-conducted unvoiced speech are converted into those of natural voices in a probabilistic manner using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Moreover, these methods are extended to convert not only NAM but also a body-conducted whispered voice (BCW) as another type of body-conducted unvoiced speech. Several experimental evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The experimental results show that 1) NAM-to-Speech effectively improves intelligibility but it causes degradation of naturalness owing to the difficulty of estimating natural fundamental frequency contours from unvoiced speech; 2) NAM-to-Whisper significantly outperforms NAM-to-Speech in terms of both intelligibility and naturalness; and 3) a single conversion model capable of converting both NAM and BCW is effectively developed in our proposed VC methods.",

This paper investigates voice conversion and modification techniques to reduce database collection and processing efforts while maintaining acceptable quality and naturalness. In a factorial design, we study the relative contributions of voice quality and prosody as well as the amount of distortions introduced by the respective signal manipulation steps. The unit selection engine in our open source and modular text-to-speech (TTS) framework MARY is extended with voice quality transformation using either GMM-based prediction or vocal tract copy resynthesis. These algorithms are then cross-combined with various prosody copy resynthesis methods. The overall expressive speech generation process functions as a postprocessing step on TTS outputs to transform neutral synthetic speech into aggressive, cheerful, or depressed speech. Cross-combinations of voice quality and prosody transformation algorithms are compared in listening tests for perceived expressive style and quality. The results show that there is a tradeoff between identification and naturalness. Combined modeling of both voice quality and prosody leads to the best identification scores at the expense of lowest naturalness ratings. The fine detail of both voice quality and prosody, as preserved by the copy synthesis, did contribute to a better identification as compared to the approximate models.",

The proposed method has two key features. First, it adopts fully convolutional architectures to construct the encoder and decoder networks so that the networks can learn conversion rules that capture the time dependencies in the acoustic feature sequences of source and target speech. Second, it uses information-theoretic regularization for the model training to ensure that the information in the attribute class label will not be lost in the conversion process. With regular conditional VAEs, the encoder and decoder are free to ignore the attribute class label input. This can be problematic since in such a situation, the attribute class label will have little effect on controlling the voice characteristics of input speech at test time. Such situations can be avoided by introducing an auxiliary classifier and training the encoder and decoder so that the attribute classes of the decoder outputs are correctly predicted by the classifier. We also present several ways to convert the feature sequence of input speech using the trained encoder and decoder and compare them in terms of audio quality through objective and subjective evaluations.

Unlike existing neural network based optimization method that relies on estimated correspondences, our method directly optimizes over implicit volumes, eliminating the challenging step of matching pixels in indoor scenes. The key to our approach is to utilize the learning-based priors to guide the optimization process of NeRF. Our system firstly adapts a monocular depth network over the target scene by finetuning on its sparse SfM reconstruction. Then, we show that the shape-radiance ambiguity of NeRF still exists in indoor environments and propose to address the issue by employing the adapted depth priors to monitor the sampling process of volume rendering. Finally, a per-pixel confidence map acquired by error computation on the rendered image can be used to further improve the depth quality. Experiments show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on indoor scenes, with surprising findings presented on the effectiveness of correspondence-based optimization and NeRF-based optimization over the adapted depth priors. In addition, we show that the guided optimization scheme does not sacrifice the original synthesis capability of neural radiance fields, improving the rendering quality on both seen and novel views.

We demonstrate the strength of our method using simulated and real-world scenes, correctly rendering novel photorealistic views underwater.

However, most approaches hinge on the visual hull derived from cost-expensive silhouette masks to obtain object surfaces. In this paper, we propose a novel Object-aware Radiance Fields (ORF) to automatically learn an object-aware geometry reconstruction. The geometric correspondences between multi-view 2D object regions and 3D implicit/explicit object surfaces are additionally exploited to boost the learning of object surfaces. Technically, a critical transparency discriminator is designed to distinguish the object-intersected and object-bypassed rays based on the estimated 2D object regions, leading to 3D implicit object surfaces. Such implicit surfaces can be directly converted into explicit object surfaces (e.g., meshes) via marching cubes. Then, we build the geometric correspondence between 2D planes and 3D meshes by rasterization, and project the estimated object regions into 3D explicit object surfaces by aggregating the object information across multiple views. The aggregated object information in 3D explicit object surfaces is further reprojected back to 2D planes, aiming to update 2D object regions and enforce them to be multi-view consistent. Extensive experiments on DTU and BlendedMVS verify the capability of ORF to produce comparable surfaces against the state-of-the-art models that demand silhouette masks.",

Automatic metrics such as BLEU correlate weakly with human annotations, resulting in a significant bias across different models and datasets. Some researchers resort to human judgment experimentation for assessing response quality, which is expensive, time consuming, and not scalable. Moreover, judges tend to evaluate a small number of dialogues, meaning that minor differences in evaluation configuration may lead to dissimilar results. In this paper, we present interpretable metrics for evaluating topic coherence by making use of distributed sentence representations. Furthermore, we introduce calculable approximations of human judgment based on conversational coherence by adopting state-of-the-art entailment techniques. Results show that our metrics can be used as a surrogate for human judgment, making it easy to evaluate dialogue systems on large-scale datasets and allowing an unbiased estimate for the quality of the responses.",

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a potent paradigm for representing scenes and synthesizing photo-realistic images. A main limitation of conventional NeRFs is that they often fail to produce high-quality renderings under novel viewpoints that are significantly different from the training viewpoints. In this paper, instead of exploiting few-shot image synthesis, we study the novel view extrapolation setting that (1) the training images can well describe an object, and (2) there is a notable discrepancy between the training and test viewpoints' distributions. We present RapNeRF (RAy Priors) as a solution. Our insight is that the inherent appearances of a 3D surface's arbitrary visible projections should be consistent. We thus propose a random ray casting policy that allows training unseen views using seen views. Furthermore, we show that a ray atlas pre-computed from the observed rays' viewing directions could further enhance the rendering quality for extrapolated views. A main limitation is that RapNeRF would remove the strong view-dependent effects because it leverages the multi-view consistency property.",
        "content2": "In this work, we present a new multi-view depth estimation method that utilizes both conventional SfM reconstruction and learning-based priors over the recently proposed neural radiance fields (NeRF). Unlike existing neural network based optimization method that relies on estimated correspondences, our method directly optimizes over implicit volumes, eliminating the challenging step of matching pixels in indoor scenes. The key to our approach is to utilize the learning-based priors to guide the optimization process of NeRF. Our system firstly adapts a monocular depth network over the target scene by finetuning on its sparse SfM reconstruction. Then, we show that the shape-radiance ambiguity of NeRF still exists in indoor environments and propose to address the issue by employing the adapted depth priors to monitor the sampling process of volume rendering. Finally, a per-pixel confidence map acquired by error computation on the rendered image can be used to further improve the depth quality. Experiments show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on indoor scenes, with surprising findings presented on the effectiveness of correspondence-based optimization and NeRF-based optimization over the adapted depth priors. In addition, we show that the guided optimization scheme does not sacrifice the original synthesis capability of neural radiance fields, improving the rendering quality on both seen and novel views.

With a small amount of found data, such attributes can be inferred and exploited for malicious purposes: voice cloning, spoofing, etc. Anonymization aims to make the data unlinkable, i.e., ensure that no utterance can be linked to its original speaker. In this paper, we investigate anonymization methods based on voice conversion. In contrast to prior work, we argue that various linkage attacks can be designed depending on the attackers' knowledge about the anonymization scheme. We compare two frequency warping-based conversion methods and a deep learning based method in three attack scenarios. The utility of converted speech is measured via the word error rate achieved by automatic speech recognition, while privacy protection is assessed by the increase in equal error rate achieved by state-of-the-art i-vector or x-vector based speaker verification. Our results show that voice conversion schemes are unable to effectively protect against an attacker that has extensive knowledge of the type of conversion and how it has been applied, but may provide some protection against less knowledgeable attackers.",

Points in the 4D space are associated with probabilities of belonging to three categories: static, deforming, and new areas. Each area is represented and regularized by a separate neural field. Second, we propose a hybrid representations based feature streaming scheme for efficiently modeling the neural fields. Our approach, coined NeRFPlayer, is evaluated on dynamic scenes captured by single hand-held cameras and multi-camera arrays, achieving comparable or superior rendering performance in terms of quality and speed comparable to recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving reconstruction in 10 seconds per frame and interactive rendering.

First, we show that, on summary state and action spaces, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) outperforms Gaussian Processes methods. Summary state and action spaces lead to good performance but require pre-engineering effort, RL knowledge, and domain expertise. In order to remove the need to define such summary spaces, we show that deep RL can also be trained efficiently on the original state and action spaces. Dialogue systems based on partially observable Markov decision processes are known to require many dialogues to train, which makes them unappealing for practical deployment. We show that a deep RL method based on an actor-critic architecture can exploit a small amount of data very efficiently. Indeed, with only a few hundred dialogues collected with a handcrafted policy, the actor-critic deep learner is considerably bootstrapped from a combination of supervised and batch RL. In addition, convergence to an optimal policy is significantly sped up compared to other deep RL methods initialized on the data with batch RL. All experiments are performed on a restaurant domain derived from the Dialogue State Tracking Challenge 2 (DSTC2) dataset.",

The response of knowledge grounded conversation might contain multiple answer entities or no entity at all. Although existing generative question answering (QA) systems can be applied to knowledge grounded conversation, they either have at most one entity in a response or cannot deal with out-of-vocabulary entities. We propose a fully data-driven generative dialogue system GenDS that is capable of generating responses based on input message and related knowledge base (KB). To generate arbitrary number of answer entities even when these entities never appear in the training set, we design a dynamic knowledge enquirer which selects different answer entities at different positions in a single response, according to different local context. It does not rely on the representations of entities, enabling our model deal with out-of-vocabulary entities. We collect a human-human conversation data (ConversMusic) with knowledge annotations. The proposed method is evaluated on CoversMusic and a public question answering dataset. Our proposed GenDS system outperforms baseline methods significantly in terms of the BLEU, entity accuracy, entity recall and human evaluation. Moreover,the experiments also demonstrate that GenDS works better even on small datasets.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose FENeRF, a 3D-aware generator that can produce view-consistent and locally-editable portrait images. Our method uses two decoupled latent codes to generate corresponding facial semantics and texture in a spatial-aligned 3D volume with shared geometry. Benefiting from such underlying 3D representation, FENeRF can jointly render the boundary-aligned image and semantic mask and use the semantic mask to edit the 3D volume via GAN inversion. We further show such 3D representation can be learned from widely available monocular image and semantic mask pairs. Moreover, we reveal that joint learning semantics and texture helps to generate finer geometry.

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are able to reconstruct scenes with unprecedented fidelity, and various recent works have extended NeRF to handle dynamic scenes. A common approach to reconstruct such non-rigid scenes is through the use of a learned deformation field mapping from coordinates in each input image into a canonical template coordinate space. However, these deformation-based approaches struggle to model changes in topology, as topological changes require a discontinuity in the deformation field, but these deformation fields are necessarily continuous. We address this limitation by lifting NeRFs into a higher dimensional space, and by representing the 5D radiance field corresponding to each individual input image as a slice through this \"hyper-space\". Our method is inspired by level set methods, which model the evolution of surfaces as slices through a higher dimensional surface. We evaluate our method on two tasks: (i) interpolating smoothly between \"moments\", i.e., configurations of the scene, seen in the input images while maintaining visual plausibility, and (ii) novel-view synthesis at fixed moments. We show that our method, which we dub HyperNeRF, outperforms existing methods on both tasks. Compared to Nerfies, HyperNeRF reduces average error rates by 4.1% for interpolation and 8.6% for novel-view synthesis, as measured by LPIPS.

The original NeRF and its recent variants, however, target opaque scenes dominated by diffuse reflection surfaces and cannot handle complex refractive surfaces well. We introduce NeRFrac to realize neural novel view synthesis of scenes captured through refractive surfaces, typically water surfaces. For each queried ray, an MLP-based Refractive Field is trained to estimate the distance from the ray origin to the refractive surface. A refracted ray at each intersection point is then computed by Snell's Law, given the input ray and the approximated local normal. Points of the scene are sampled along the refracted ray and are sent to a Radiance Field for further radiance estimation. We show that from a sparse set of images, our model achieves accurate novel view synthesis of the scene underneath the refractive surface and simultaneously reconstructs the refractive surface. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method with synthetic and real scenes seen through water surfaces.

        "content1": "This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing an animatable human model from a multi-view video. Some recent works have proposed to decompose a non-rigidly deforming scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of deformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space, thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field, which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these representations cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we introduce neural blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based on the skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human skeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can regularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend weight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new deformation fields to animate the human model. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent human synthesis methods.

Unlike the existing work, NeRF2NeRF, which is based on traditional optimization methods and needs human annotated keypoints, we propose DReg-NeRF to solve the NeRF registration problem on object-centric scenes without human intervention. After training NeRF models, our DReg-NeRF first extracts features from the occupancy grid in NeRF. Subsequently, our DReg-NeRF utilizes a transformer architecture with self-attention and cross-attention layers to learn the relations between pairwise NeRF blocks. In contrast to state-of-the-art (SOTA) point cloud registration methods, the decoupled correspondences are supervised by surface fields without any ground truth overlapping labels. We construct a novel view synthesis dataset with 1,700+ 3D objects obtained from Objaverse to train our network. When evaluated on the test set, our proposed method beats the SOTA point cloud registration methods by a large margin with a mean RPE = 9.67* and a mean RTE = 0.038.

Taking a NeRF pretrained from multi-view RGB images as input, Instance-NeRF can learn 3D instance segmentation of a given scene, represented as an instance field component of the NeRF model. To this end, we adopt a 3D proposal-based mask prediction network on the sampled volumetric features from NeRF, which generates discrete 3D instance masks. The coarse 3D mask prediction is then projected to image space to match 2D segmentation masks from different views generated by existing panoptic segmentation models, which are used to supervise the training of the instance field. Notably, beyond generating consistent 2D segmentation maps from novel views, Instance-NeRF can query instance information at any 3D point, which greatly enhances NeRF object segmentation and manipulation. Our method is also one of the first to achieve such results in pure inference. Experimented on synthetic and real-world NeRF datasets with complex indoor scenes, Instance-NeRF surpasses previous NeRF segmentation works and competitive 2D segmentation methods in segmentation performance on unseen views.

We propose an algorithm based on converting the LPC spectrum and predicting the residual as a function of the target envelope parameters. We conduct listening tests based on speaker discrimination of same/difference pairs to measure the accuracy by which the converted voices match the desired target voices. To establish the level of human performance as a baseline, we first measure the ability of listeners to discriminate between original speech utterances under three conditions: normal, fundamental frequency and duration normalized, and LPC coded. Additionally, the spectral parameter conversion function is tested in isolation by listening to source, target, and converted speakers as LPC coded speech. The results show that the speaker identity of speech whose LPC spectrum has been converted can be recognized as the target speaker with the same level of performance as discriminating between LPC coded speech. However, the level of discrimination of converted utterances produced by the full VC system is significantly below that of speaker discrimination of natural speech.",

They offer flexibility, can be easily adapted to new domains, and require minimal domain engineering. A common criticism of these systems is that they seldom understand or use the available dialog history effectively. In this paper, we take an empirical approach to understanding how these models use the available dialog history by studying the sensitivity of the models to artificially introduced unnatural changes or perturbations to their context at test time. We experiment with 10 different types of perturbations on 4 multi-turn dialog datasets and find that commonly used neural dialog architectures like recurrent and transformer-based seq2seq models are rarely sensitive to most perturbations such as missing or reordering utterances, shuffling words, etc. Also, by open-sourcing our code, we believe that it will serve as a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating dialog systems in the future.",

However, current NeRF-based methods cannot enable users to perform user-controlled shape deformation in the scene. While existing works have proposed some approaches to modify the radiance field according to the user's constraints, the modification is limited to color editing or object translation and rotation. In this paper, we propose a method that allows users to perform controllable shape deformation on the implicit representation of the scene, and synthesizes the novel view images of the edited scene without re-training the network. Specifically, we establish a correspondence between the extracted explicit mesh representation and the implicit neural representation of the target scene. Users can first utilize well-developed mesh-based deformation methods to deform the mesh representation of the scene. Our method then utilizes user edits from the mesh representation to bend the camera rays by introducing a tetrahedra mesh as a proxy, obtaining the rendering results of the edited scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can achieve ideal editing results not only on synthetic data, but also on real scenes captured by users.",

However, such model suffers from the limitation that it can only convert the voice to the speakers in the training data, which narrows down the applicable scenario of VC. In this paper, we proposed a novel one-shot VC approach which is able to perform VC by only an example utterance from source and target speaker respectively, and the source and target speaker do not even need to be seen during training. This is achieved by disentangling speaker and content representations with instance normalization (IN). Objective and subjective evaluation shows that our model is able to generate the voice similar to target speaker. In addition to the performance measurement, we also demonstrate that this model is able to learn meaningful speaker representations without any supervision.",

We present an extension of mip-NeRF (a NeRF variant that addresses sampling and aliasing) that uses a non-linear scene parameterization, online distillation, and a novel distortion-based regularizer to overcome the challenges presented by unbounded scenes. Our model, which we dub \"mip-NeRF 360\" as we target scenes in which the camera rotates 360 degrees around a point, reduces mean-squared error by 57% compared to mip-NeRF, and is able to produce realistic synthesized views and detailed depth maps for highly intricate, unbounded real-world scenes.",

However, F0 can robustly represent various prosody signals (e.g., emotional prosody). In this study, we propose an effective method based on the NNs to train the normalized-segment-F0 features (NSF0) for emotional prosody conversion. Meanwhile, the proposed method adopts deep belief networks (DBNs) to train spectrum features for voice conversion. By using these approaches, the proposed method can change the spectrum and the prosody for the emotional voice at the same time. Moreover, the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for voice emotional conversion.",

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has become a popular framework for learning implicit 3D representations and addressing different tasks such as novel-view synthesis or depth-map estimation. However, in downstream applications where decisions need to be made based on automatic predictions, it is critical to leverage the confidence associated with the model estimations. Whereas uncertainty quantification is a long-standing problem in Machine Learning, it has been largely overlooked in the recent NeRF literature. In this context, we propose Stochastic Neural Radiance Fields (S-NeRF), a generalization of standard NeRF that learns a probability distribution over all the possible radiance fields modeling the scene. This distribution allows to quantify the uncertainty associated with the scene information provided by the model. S-NeRF optimization is posed as a Bayesian learning problem that is efficiently addressed using the Variational Inference framework. Exhaustive experiments over benchmark datasets demonstrate that S-NeRF is able to provide more reliable predictions and confidence values than generic approaches previously proposed for uncertainty estimation in other domains.",

By leveraging the joint language-image embedding space of the recent Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model, we propose a unified framework that allows manipulating NeRF in a user-friendly way, using either a short text prompt or an exemplar image. Specifically, to combine the novel view synthesis capability of NeRF and the controllable manipulation ability of latent representations from generative models, we introduce a disentangled conditional NeRF architecture that allows individual control over both shape and appearance. This is achieved by performing the shape conditioning via applying a learned deformation field to the positional encoding and deferring color conditioning to the volumetric rendering stage. To bridge this disentangled latent representation to the CLIP embedding, we design two code mappers that take a CLIP embedding as input and update the latent codes to reflect the targeted editing. The mappers are trained with a CLIP-based matching loss to ensure the manipulation accuracy. Furthermore, we propose an inverse optimization method that accurately projects an input image to the latent codes for manipulation to enable editing on real images. We evaluate our approach by extensive experiments on a variety of text prompts and exemplar images and also provide an intuitive editing interface for real-time user interaction.",

The dialogue contexts include information about the machine acts and the status of the user goal.

Moreover, pre-trained features are adopted. AUTOVC used dvector to extract speaker information, and self-supervised learning (SSL) features like wav2vec 2.0 is used in FragmentVC to extract the phonetic content information. Different from previous works, we proposed S2VC that utilizes Self-Supervised features as both source and target features for VC model.

        "content1": "Differences in speaker characteristics, recording conditions, and signal processing algorithms affect output quality in voice conversion systems. This study focuses on formulating robust techniques for a codebook mapping based voice conversion algorithm. Three different methods are used to improve voice conversion performance: confidence measures, pre-emphasis, and spectral equalization. Analysis is performed for each method and the implementation details are discussed. The first method employs confidence measures in the training stage to eliminate problematic pairs of source and target speech units that might result from possible misalignments, speaking style differences or pronunciation variations. Four confidence measures are developed based on the spectral distance, fundamental frequency (f0) distance, energy distance, and duration distance between the source and target speech units. The second method focuses on the importance of pre-emphasis in line-spectral frequency (LSF) based vocal tract modeling and transformation. The last method, spectral equalization, is aimed at reducing the differences in the source and target long-term spectra when the source and target recording conditions are significantly different. The voice conversion algorithm that employs the proposed techniques is compared with the baseline voice conversion algorithm with objective tests as well as three subjective listening tests. First, similarity to the target voice is evaluated in a subjective listening test and it is shown that the proposed algorithm improves similarity to the target voice by 23.0%. An ABX test is performed and the proposed algorithm is preferred over the baseline algorithm by 76.4%.

Voice characteristic features are grouped into three main categories: (a) the spectral features at formants; (b) the pitch and intonation pattern; (c) the glottal pulse shape. Modelling and transformation methods for each group of voice features are outlined. The spectral features at formants are modelled using a two-dimensional phoneme-dependent HMM. Subband frequency warping is used for spectrum transformation where the subbands are centred on estimates of formant trajectories. The F0 contour, extracted from autocorrelation-based pitchmarks, is used for modelling the pitch and intonation patterns of speech. A PSOLA based method is used for transformation of pitch, intonation patterns and speaking rate. Finally a method based on deconvolution of the vocal tract is used for modelling and mapping of the glottal pulse. The experimental results present illustrations of transformations of the various characteristics and perceptual evaluations.",

Seq2Seq has been outstanding at numerous tasks involving sequence modeling such as speech synthesis and recognition, machine translation, and image captioning. In contrast to current VC techniques, our method 1) stabilizes and accelerates the training procedure by considering guided attention and proposed context preservation losses, 2) allows not only spectral envelopes but also fundamental frequency contours and durations of speech to be converted, 3) requires no context information such as phoneme labels, and 4) requires no time-aligned source and target speech data in advance. In our experiment, the proposed VC framework can be trained in only one day, using only one GPU of an NVIDIA Tesla K80, while the quality of the synthesized speech is higher than that of speech converted by Gaussian mixture model-based VC and is comparable to that of speech generated by recurrent neural network-based text-to-speech synthesis, which can be regarded as an upper limit on VC performance.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose FENeRF, a 3D-aware generator that can produce view-consistent and locally-editable portrait images. Our method uses two decoupled latent codes to generate corresponding facial semantics and texture in a spatial-aligned 3D volume with shared geometry. Benefiting from such underlying 3D representation, FENeRF can jointly render the boundary-aligned image and semantic mask and use the semantic mask to edit the 3D volume via GAN inversion. We further show such 3D representation can be learned from widely available monocular image and semantic mask pairs. Moreover, we reveal that joint learning semantics and texture helps to generate finer geometry. Our experiments demonstrate that FENeRF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various face editing tasks.",

To tackle these shortcomings, we propose to transfer knowledge from other speech processing tasks where large-scale corpora are easily available, typically text-to-speech (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR). We argue that VC models initialized with such pretrained ASR or TTS model parameters can generate effective hidden representations for high-fidelity, highly intelligible converted speech. In this work, we examine our proposed method in a parallel, one-to-one setting.

In particular, voice conversion to modify a source voice so that it is perceived as a specific target voice involves prosodic and spectral transformations that produce significant quality degradation. Choosing among the current voice conversion methods represents a trade-off between the similarity of the converted voice to the target voice and the quality of the resulting converted speech, both rated by listeners. This paper presents a new voice conversion method termed Weighted Frequency Warping that has a good balance between similarity and quality. This method uses a time-varying piecewise-linear frequency warping function and an energy correction filter, and it combines typical probabilistic techniques and frequency warping transformations. Compared to standard probabilistic systems, Weighted Frequency Warping results in a significant increase in quality scores, whereas the conversion scores remain almost unaltered. This paper carefully discusses the theoretical aspects of the method and the details of its implementation, and the results of an international evaluation of the new system are also included.",

The field saw remarkable progress during the last few years, and existing event-based 3D reconstruction approaches recover sparse point clouds of the scene. However, such sparsity is a limiting factor in many cases, especially in computer vision and graphics, that has not been addressed satisfactorily so far. Accordingly, this paper proposes the first approach for 3D-consistent, dense and photorealistic novel view synthesis using just a single colour event stream as input. At its core is a neural radiance field trained entirely in a self-supervised manner from events while preserving the original resolution of the colour event channels. Next, our ray sampling strategy is tailored to events and allows for data-efficient training. At test, our method produces results in the RGB space at unprecedented quality. We evaluate our method qualitatively and numerically on several challenging synthetic and real scenes and show that it produces significantly denser and more visually appealing renderings than the existing methods. We also demonstrate robustness in challenging scenarios with fast motion and under low lighting conditions.

First, we show that, on summary state and action spaces, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) outperforms Gaussian Processes methods. Summary state and action spaces lead to good performance but require pre-engineering effort, RL knowledge, and domain expertise. In order to remove the need to define such summary spaces, we show that deep RL can also be trained efficiently on the original state and action spaces. Dialogue systems based on partially observable Markov decision processes are known to require many dialogues to train, which makes them unappealing for practical deployment. We show that a deep RL method based on an actor-critic architecture can exploit a small amount of data very efficiently. Indeed, with only a few hundred dialogues collected with a handcrafted policy, the actor-critic deep learner is considerably bootstrapped from a combination of supervised and batch RL. In addition, convergence to an optimal policy is significantly sped up compared to other deep RL methods initialized on the data with batch RL. All experiments are performed on a restaurant domain derived from the Dialogue State Tracking Challenge 2 (DSTC2) dataset.",

The proposed models are tested on large-scale listening test results of the Voice Conversion Challenge (VCC) 2018. Experimental results show that the predicted scores of the proposed MOSNet are highly correlated with human MOS ratings at the system level while being fairly correlated with human MOS ratings at the utterance level. Meanwhile, we have modified MOSNet to predict the similarity scores, and the preliminary results show that the predicted scores are also fairly correlated with human ratings. These results confirm that the proposed models could be used as a computational evaluator to measure the MOS of VC systems to reduce the need for expensive human rating.",

        "content1": "Any modification applied to speech signals has an impact on their perceptual quality. In particular, voice conversion to modify a source voice so that it is perceived as a specific target voice involves prosodic and spectral transformations that produce significant quality degradation. Choosing among the current voice conversion methods represents a trade-off between the similarity of the converted voice to the target voice and the quality of the resulting converted speech, both rated by listeners. This paper presents a new voice conversion method termed Weighted Frequency Warping that has a good balance between similarity and quality. This method uses a time-varying piecewise-linear frequency warping function and an energy correction filter, and it combines typical probabilistic techniques and frequency warping transformations. Compared to standard probabilistic systems, Weighted Frequency Warping results in a significant increase in quality scores, whereas the conversion scores remain almost unaltered. This paper carefully discusses the theoretical aspects of the method and the details of its implementation, and the results of an international evaluation of the new system are also included.",

Modularized systems rely on DST to interact with the KB, which is expensive in terms of annotation and inference time. End-to-end systems use the KB directly as input, but they cannot scale when the KB is larger than a few hundred entries. In this paper, we propose a method to embed the KB, of any size, directly into the model parameters. The resulting model does not require any DST or template responses, nor the KB as input, and it can dynamically update its KB via fine-tuning. We evaluate our solution in five task-oriented dialogue datasets with small, medium, and large KB size.

We propose a fully data-driven generative dialogue system GenDS that is capable of generating responses based on input message and related knowledge base (KB). To generate arbitrary number of answer entities even when these entities never appear in the training set, we design a dynamic knowledge enquirer which selects different answer entities at different positions in a single response, according to different local context.

The parallel exemplars (dictionary) consist of the source exemplars and target exemplars, having the same texts uttered by the source and target speakers. The input source signal is decomposed into the source exemplars, noise exemplars obtained from the input signal, and their weights (activities). Then, by using the weights of the source exemplars, the converted signal is constructed from the target exemplars. We carried out speaker conversion tasks using clean speech data and noise-added speech data. The effectiveness of this method was confirmed by comparing its effectiveness with that of a conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based method.",

However, in downstream applications where decisions need to be made based on automatic predictions, it is critical to leverage the confidence associated with the model estimations. Whereas uncertainty quantification is a long-standing problem in Machine Learning, it has been largely overlooked in the recent NeRF literature. In this context, we propose Stochastic Neural Radiance Fields (S-NeRF), a generalization of standard NeRF that learns a probability distribution over all the possible radiance fields modeling the scene. This distribution allows to quantify the uncertainty associated with the scene information provided by the model. S-NeRF optimization is posed as a Bayesian learning problem that is efficiently addressed using the Variational Inference framework. Exhaustive experiments over benchmark datasets demonstrate that S-NeRF is able to provide more reliable predictions and confidence values than generic approaches previously proposed for uncertainty estimation in other domains.",

The LPC residuals are adjusted to match the target speakers average pitch. To study effects of the amount of training on performance, data sets of varying sizes are created by automatically selecting subsets of all available diphones by a vector quantization method. In an objective evaluation, the proposed method is found to perform more reliably for small training sets than a previous approach.

The latter can be evaluated from various points of view, such as recognition and understanding rates, dialogue naturalness and robustness against recognition errors. Evaluation usually requires compiling a large corpus of words and sentences uttered by users, relevant to the application domain the system is designed for. This paper proposes a new technique that makes it possible to reuse such a corpus for the evaluation and to check the performance of the system when different dialogue strategies are used. The technique is based on the automatic generation of conversations between the dialogue system, together with an additional dialogue system called user simulator that represents the user’s interaction with the dialogue system. The technique has been applied to evaluate a dialogue system developed in our lab using two different recognition front-ends and two different dialogue strategies to handle user confirmations. The experiments show that the prompt-dependent recognition front-end achieves better results, but that this front-end is appropriate only if users limit their utterances to those related to the current system prompt. The prompt-independent front-end achieves inferior results, but enables front-end users to utter any permitted utterance at any time, irrespective of the system prompt. In consequence, this front-end may allow a more natural and comfortable interaction. The experiments also show that the re-prompting confirmation strategy enhances system performance for both recognition front-ends.",

In more detail, DSTC7 focuses on developing and exploring end-to-end technologies for the following three pragmatic challenges: (1) sentence selection for multiple domains, (2) generation of informational responses grounded in external knowledge, and (3) audio visual scene-aware dialog to allow conversations with users about objects and events around them.\nThis paper summarizes the overall setup and results of DSTC7, including detailed descriptions of the different tracks, provided datasets and annotations, overview of the submitted systems and their final results. For Track 1, LSTM-based models performed best across both datasets, allowing teams to effectively handle task variants where no correct answer was present or when multiple paraphrases were included. For Track 2, RNN-based architectures augmented to incorporate facts by using two types of encoders: a dialog encoder and a fact encoder plus using attention mechanisms and a pointer-generator approach provided the best results. Finally, for Track 3, the best model used Hierarchical Attention mechanisms to combine the text and vision information obtaining a 22% better result than the baseline LSTM system for the human rating score.\nMore than 220 participants were registered and about 40 teams participated in the final challenge. 32 scientific papers reporting the systems submitted to DSTC7, and 3 general technical papers for dialog technologies, were presented during the one-day wrap-up workshop at AAAI-19. During the workshop, we reviewed the state-of-the-art systems, shared novel approaches to the DSTC7 tasks, and discussed the future directions for the challenge (DSTC8).",

We apply eigenvoice conversion (EVC) to both VC frameworks. Using multiple parallel data sets consisting of utterance-pairs of the user and multiple pre-stored speakers, an eigenvoice Gaussian mixture model (EV-GMM) is trained in advance. Unsupervised adaptation of the EV-GMM is available to construct the conversion model for arbitrary target speakers in one-to-many VC or arbitrary source speakers in many-to-one VC using only a small amount of their speech data.

The alignment of phonetically equivalent source and target vectors is not problematic when the training corpus is parallel, which means that both speakers utter the same training sentences. However, in some practical situations, such as cross-lingual voice conversion, it is not possible to obtain such parallel utterances. With an aim towards increasing the versatility of current voice conversion systems, this paper proposes a new iterative alignment method that allows pairing phonetically equivalent acoustic vectors from nonparallel utterances from different speakers, even under cross-lingual conditions. This method is based on existing voice conversion techniques, and it does not require any phonetic or linguistic information. Subjective evaluation experiments show that the performance of the resulting voice conversion system is very similar to that of an equivalent system trained on a parallel corpus.",

We propose editable neural radiance fields that enable end-users to easily edit dynamic scenes and even support topological changes. Input with an image sequence from a single camera, our network is trained fully automatically and models topologically varying dynamics using our picked-out surface key points. Then end-users can edit the scene by easily dragging the key points to desired new positions. To achieve this, we propose a scene analysis method to detect and initialize key points by considering the dynamics in the scene, and a weighted key points strategy to model topologically varying dynamics by joint key points and weights optimization. Our method supports intuitive multi-dimensional (up to 3D) editing and can generate novel scenes that are unseen in the input sequence. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality editing on various dynamic scenes and outperforms the state-of-the-art.

We note that speaker identity is also characterized by the prosody features such as fundamental frequency (F0), energy contour and duration. Motivated by this, we propose a framework that can perform F0, energy contour and duration conversion. In the traditional exemplar-based sparse representation approach to voice conversion, a general source-target dictionary of exemplars is constructed to establish the correspondence between source and target speakers. In this work, we propose a Phonetically Aware Sparse Representation of fundamental frequency and energy contour by using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). Our idea is motivated by the facts that CWT decompositions of F0 and energy contours describe prosody patterns in different temporal scales and allow for effective prosody manipulation in speech synthesis. Furthermore, phonetically aware exemplars lead to better estimation of activation matrix, therefore, possibly better conversion of prosody. We also propose a phonetically aware duration conversion framework which takes into account both phone-level and sentence-level speaking rates. We report that the proposed prosody conversion outperforms the traditional prosody conversion techniques in both objective and subjective evaluations.",

In this setup, the pose of the individual events --required to integrate them into the radiance fields-- remains to be unknown. Our method jointly optimizes the pose and the radiance field, in an efficient manner by leveraging the collection of events at once and actively sampling the events during learning. Experiments conducted on both realistically rendered and real-world datasets demonstrate a significant benefit of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art and the compared baseline. This shows a promising direction for modeling deformable neural radiance fields in real-world dynamic scenes. Our code and data will be publicly available.",

We explore the possibility of creating dialogue data through the interaction between a dialogue system and a user simulator. Our goal is to develop a modelling framework that can incorporate new dialogue scenarios through self-play between the two agents. In this framework, we first pre-train the two agents on a collection of source domain dialogues, which equips the agents to converse with each other via natural language. With further fine-tuning on a small amount of target domain data, the agents continue to interact with the aim of improving their behaviors using reinforcement learning with structured reward functions. In experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, two practical transfer learning problems are investigated: 1) domain adaptation and 2) single-to-multiple domain transfer. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is highly effective in bootstrapping the performance of the two agents in transfer learning.

However, early studies have been limited to very low dimensional spaces and the learning has exhibited convergence problems. Here we investigate learning from human interaction using the Bayesian Update of Dialogue State system. This dynamic Bayesian network based system has an optimisation space covering more than one hundred features, allowing a wide range of behaviours to be learned.

Since the original paper by Mildenhall et al., more than 250 preprints were published, with more than 100 eventually being accepted in tier one Computer Vision Conferences. Given NeRF popularity and the current interest in this research area, we believe it necessary to compile a comprehensive survey of NeRF papers from the past two years, which we organized into both architecture, and application based taxonomies. We also provide an introduction to the theory of NeRF based novel view synthesis, and a benchmark comparison of the performance and speed of key NeRF models. By creating this survey, we hope to introduce new researchers to NeRF, provide a helpful reference for influential works in this field, as well as motivate future research directions with our discussion section.",

Thus far, NeRF and its variants have ignored these cases. However, since the NeRF framework is based on volumetric rendering, it has inherent capability to account for the medium's effects, once modeled appropriately. We develop a new rendering model for NeRFs in scattering media, which is based on the SeaThru image formation model, and suggest a suitable architecture for learning both scene information and medium parameters. We demonstrate the strength of our method using simulated and real-world scenes, correctly rendering novel photorealistic views underwater. Even more excitingly, we can render clear views of these scenes, removing the medium between the camera and the scene and reconstructing the appearance and depth of far objects, which are severely occluded by the medium.

        "content1": "We propose im2nerf, a learning framework that predicts a continuous neural object representation given a single input image in the wild, supervised by only segmentation output from off-the-shelf recognition methods. The standard approach to constructing neural radiance fields takes advantage of multi-view consistency and requires many calibrated views of a scene, a requirement that cannot be satisfied when learning on large-scale image data in the wild. We take a step towards addressing this shortcoming by introducing a model that encodes the input image into a disentangled object representation that contains a code for object shape, a code for object appearance, and an estimated camera pose from which the object image is captured. Our model conditions a NeRF on the predicted object representation and uses volume rendering to generate images from novel views. We train the model end-to-end on a large collection of input images. As the model is only provided with single-view images, the problem is highly under-constrained. Therefore, in addition to using a reconstruction loss on the synthesized input view, we use an auxiliary adversarial loss on the novel rendered views. Furthermore, we leverage object symmetry and cycle camera pose consistency. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on the ShapeNet dataset as well as qualitative experiments on Open Images dataset. We show that in all cases, im2nerf achieves the state-of-the-art performance for novel view synthesis from a single-view unposed image in the wild.",

Our neural dialogue system can directly interact with a structured database to assist users in accessing information and accomplishing certain tasks. The reinforcement learning based dialogue manager offers robust capabilities to handle noises caused by other components of the dialogue system.

Training is performed without any form of supervision: no lyrics or any kind of phonetic features, no notes, and no matching samples between singers. The proposed network employs a single CNN encoder for all singers, a single WaveNet decoder, and a classifier that enforces the latent representation to be singer-agnostic. Each singer is represented by one embedding vector, which the decoder is conditioned on. In order to deal with relatively small datasets, we propose a new data augmentation scheme, as well as new training losses and protocols that are based on backtranslation.

This paper introduces a data-driven user simulator based on an encoder-decoder recurrent neural network. The model takes as input a sequence of dialogue contexts and outputs a sequence of dialogue acts corresponding to user intentions. The dialogue contexts include information about the machine acts and the status of the user goal. We show on the Dialogue State Tracking Challenge 2 (DSTC2) dataset that the sequence-to-sequence model outperforms an agenda-based simulator and an n-gram simulator, according to F-score. Furthermore, we show how this model can be used on the original action space and thereby models user behaviour with finer granularity.",

        "content1": "In a spoken dialog system, determining which action a machine should take in a given situation is a difficult problem because automatic speech recognition is unreliable and hence the state of the conversation can never be known with certainty. Much of the research in spoken dialog systems centres on mitigating this uncertainty and recent work has focussed on three largely disparate techniques: parallel dialog state hypotheses, local use of confidence scores, and automated planning. While in isolation each of these approaches can improve action selection, taken together they currently lack a unified statistical framework that admits global optimization. In this paper we cast a spoken dialog system as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We show how this formulation unifies and extends existing techniques to form a single principled framework. A number of illustrations are used to show qualitatively the potential benefits of POMDPs compared to existing techniques, and empirical results from dialog simulations are presented which demonstrate significant quantitative gains. Finally, some of the key challenges to advancing this method – in particular scalability – are briefly outlined.",

While showing impressive performance, it relies on the availability of dense input views with highly accurate camera poses, thus limiting its application in real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce Sparse Pose Adjusting Radiance Field (SPARF), to address the challenge of novel-view synthesis given only few wide-baseline input images (as low as 3) with noisy camera poses. Our approach exploits multi-view geometry constraints in order to jointly learn the NeRF and refine the camera poses. By relying on pixel matches extracted between the input views, our multi-view correspondence objective enforces the optimized scene and camera poses to converge to a global and geometrically accurate solution. Our depth consistency loss further encourages the reconstructed scene to be consistent from any viewpoint. Our approach sets a new state of the art in the sparse-view regime on multiple challenging datasets.",

Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model has significant advantages over the baselines in both the evaluation of dialog generation and recommendation.

In addition, the large number of parameters in the statistical model cannot be well estimated from the limited parallel training data, which will result in the over-fitting problem. In this work, we investigate a robust transformation function for voice conversion using conditional restricted Boltzmann machine. Conditional restricted Boltzmann machine, which performs linear and non-linear transformations simultaneously, is proposed to learn the relationship between source and target speech. CMU ARCTIC corpus is adopted in the experimental validations. The number of parallel training utterances is varied from 2 to 40. For these different training situations, two objective evaluation measures, mel-cepstral distortion and correlation coefficient, both show that the proposed method outperforms the main stream joint density Gaussian mixture model method consistently.",

So far, most of the voice conversion studies mainly focus only on the speech voice conversion that is different from singing voice conversion. We note that singing conveys both lexical and emotional information through words and tones. It is one of the most expressive components in music and a means of entertainment as well as self expression. In this paper, we propose a novel singing voice conversion framework, that is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The proposed GAN-based conversion framework, that we call SINGAN, consists of two neural networks: a discriminator to distinguish natural and converted singing voice, and a generator to deceive the discriminator. With GAN, we minimize the differences of the distributions between the original target parameters and the generated singing parameters. To our best knowledge, this is the first framework that uses generative adversarial networks for singing voice conversion. In experiments, we show that the proposed method effectively converts singing voices and outperforms the baseline approach.",

Empirical results demonstrate that TRADE achieves state-of-the-art joint goal accuracy of 48.62% for the five domains of MultiWOZ, a human-human dialogue dataset.

        "content1": "Conversational agents have come increasingly closer to human competence in open-domain dialogue settings; however, such models can reflect insensitive, hurtful, or entirely incoherent viewpoints that erode a user's trust in the moral integrity of the system. Moral deviations are difficult to mitigate because moral judgments are not universal, and there may be multiple competing judgments that apply to a situation simultaneously. In this work, we introduce a new resource, not to authoritatively resolve moral ambiguities, but instead to facilitate systematic understanding of the intuitions, values and moral judgments reflected in the utterances of dialogue systems. The Moral Integrity Corpus, MIC, is such a resource, which captures the moral assumptions of 38k prompt-reply pairs, using 99k distinct Rules of Thumb (RoTs). Each RoT reflects a particular moral conviction that can explain why a chatbot's reply may appear acceptable or problematic. We further organize RoTs with a set of 9 moral and social attributes and benchmark performance for attribute classification. Most importantly, we show that current neural language models can automatically generate new RoTs that reasonably describe previously unseen interactions, but they still struggle with certain scenarios. Our findings suggest that MIC will be a useful resource for understanding and language models' implicit moral assumptions and flexibly benchmarking the integrity of conversational agents.

        "content1": "Neural implicit 3D representations have emerged as a powerful paradigm for reconstructing surfaces from multi-view images and synthesizing novel views. Unfortunately, existing methods such as DVR or IDR require accurate per-pixel object masks as supervision. At the same time, neural radiance fields have revolutionized novel view synthesis. However, NeRF's estimated volume density does not admit accurate surface reconstruction. Our key insight is that implicit surface models and radiance fields can be formulated in a unified way, enabling both surface and volume rendering using the same model. This unified perspective enables novel, more efficient sampling procedures and the ability to reconstruct accurate surfaces without input masks. We compare our method on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and a synthetic indoor dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that we outperform NeRF in terms of reconstruction quality while performing on par with IDR without requiring masks.",
        "content2": "Continual learning in task-oriented dialogue systems can allow us to add new domains and functionalities through time without incurring the high cost of a whole system retraining. In this paper, we propose a continual learning benchmark for task-oriented dialogue systems with 37 domains to be learned continuously in four settings, such as intent recognition, state tracking, natural language generation, and end-to-end. Moreover, we implement and compare multiple existing continual learning baselines, and we propose a simple yet effective architectural method based on residual adapters. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed architectural method and a simple replay-based strategy perform comparably well but they both achieve inferior performance to the multi-task learning baseline, in where all the data are shown at once, showing that continual learning in task-oriented dialogue systems is a challenging task. Furthermore, we reveal several trade-offs between different continual learning methods in term of parameter usage and memory size, which are important in the design of a task-oriented dialogue system. The proposed benchmark is released together with several baselines to promote more research in this direction.",

A comparative study of voice conversion using an ANN model and the state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is conducted. The results of voice conversion, evaluated using subjective and objective measures, confirm that an ANN-based VC system performs as good as that of a GMM-based VC system, and the quality of the transformed speech is intelligible and possesses the characteristics of a target speaker. In this paper, we also address the issue of dependency of voice conversion techniques on parallel data between the source and the target speakers. While there have been efforts to use nonparallel data and speaker adaptation techniques, it is important to investigate techniques which capture speaker-specific characteristics of a target speaker, and avoid any need for source speaker's data either for training or for adaptation. In this paper, we propose a voice conversion approach using an ANN model to capture speaker-specific characteristics of a target speaker and demonstrate that such a voice conversion approach can perform monolingual as well as cross-lingual voice conversion of an arbitrary source speaker.",

First, we show that, on summary state and action spaces, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) outperforms Gaussian Processes methods. Summary state and action spaces lead to good performance but require pre-engineering effort, RL knowledge, and domain expertise. In order to remove the need to define such summary spaces, we show that deep RL can also be trained efficiently on the original state and action spaces. Dialogue systems based on partially observable Markov decision processes are known to require many dialogues to train, which makes them unappealing for practical deployment. We show that a deep RL method based on an actor-critic architecture can exploit a small amount of data very efficiently. Indeed, with only a few hundred dialogues collected with a handcrafted policy, the actor-critic deep learner is considerably bootstrapped from a combination of supervised and batch RL. In addition, convergence to an optimal policy is significantly sped up compared to other deep RL methods initialized on the data with batch RL.

        "content1": "Tremendous progress in deep generative models has led to photorealistic image synthesis. While achieving compelling results, most approaches operate in the two-dimensional image domain, ignoring the three-dimensional nature of our world. Several recent works therefore propose generative models which are 3D-aware, i.e., scenes are modeled in 3D and then rendered differentiably to the image plane. While this leads to impressive 3D consistency, the camera needs to be modelled as well and we show in this work that these methods are sensitive to the choice of prior camera distributions. Current approaches assume fixed intrinsics and predefined priors over camera pose ranges, and parameter tuning is typically required for real-world data. If the data distribution is not matched, results degrade significantly. Our key hypothesis is that learning a camera generator jointly with the image generator leads to a more principled approach to 3D-aware image synthesis. Further, we propose to decompose the scene into a background and foreground model, leading to more efficient and disentangled scene representations. While training from raw, unposed image collections, we learn a 3D- and camera-aware generative model which faithfully recovers not only the image but also the camera data distribution. At test time, our model generates images with explicit control over the camera as well as the shape and appearance of the scene.",

We show that a single handheld consumer-grade camera is sufficient to synthesize sophisticated renderings of a dynamic scene from novel virtual camera views, e.g. a `bullet-time' video effect. NR-NeRF disentangles the dynamic scene into a canonical volume and its deformation. Scene deformation is implemented as ray bending, where straight rays are deformed non-rigidly. We also propose a novel rigidity network to better constrain rigid regions of the scene, leading to more stable results. The ray bending and rigidity network are trained without explicit supervision. Our formulation enables dense correspondence estimation across views and time, and compelling video editing applications such as motion exaggeration. Our code will be open sourced.",

Thus far, NeRF and its variants have ignored these cases. However, since the NeRF framework is based on volumetric rendering, it has inherent capability to account for the medium's effects, once modeled appropriately. We develop a new rendering model for NeRFs in scattering media, which is based on the SeaThru image formation model, and suggest a suitable architecture for learning both scene information and medium parameters. We demonstrate the strength of our method using simulated and real-world scenes, correctly rendering novel photorealistic views underwater.

Recent NeRF-based advances have gained popularity for remarkable realistic novel view synthesis. However, most of them heavily rely on accurate camera poses estimation, while few recent methods can only optimize the unknown camera poses in roughly forward-facing scenes with relatively short camera trajectories and require rough camera poses initialization. Differently, our GNeRF only utilizes randomly initialized poses for complex outside-in scenarios. We propose a novel two-phases end-to-end framework. The first phase takes the use of GANs into the new realm for optimizing coarse camera poses and radiance fields jointly, while the second phase refines them with additional photometric loss. We overcome local minima using a hybrid and iterative optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on a variety of synthetic and natural scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of GNeRF. More impressively, our approach outperforms the baselines favorably in those scenes with repeated patterns or even low textures that are regarded as extremely challenging before.",

In this work, we investigate a robust transformation function for voice conversion using conditional restricted Boltzmann machine.

First, the recommended items cannot be always incorporated into the generated replies precisely and appropriately. Second, only the items mentioned in the training corpus have a chance to be recommended in the conversation. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel framework called NTRD for recommender dialogue system that decouples the dialogue generation from the item recommendation. NTRD has two key components, i.e., response template generator and item selector. The former adopts an encoder-decoder model to generate a response template with slot locations tied to target items, while the latter fills in slot locations with the proper items using a sufficient attention mechanism. Our approach combines the strengths of both classical slot filling approaches (that are generally controllable) and modern neural NLG approaches (that are generally more natural and accurate). Extensive experiments on the benchmark ReDial show our NTRD significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods. Besides, our approach has the unique advantage to produce novel items that do not appear in the training set of dialogue corpus. The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/jokieleung/NTRD}.",

The proposed method is general purpose, high quality, and parallel-data free and works without any extra data, modules, or alignment procedure. It also avoids over-smoothing, which occurs in many conventional statistical model-based VC methods. Our method, called CycleGAN-VC, uses a cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) with gated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and an identity-mapping loss. A CycleGAN learns forward and inverse mappings simultaneously using adversarial and cycle-consistency losses. This makes it possible to find an optimal pseudo pair from unpaired data. Furthermore, the adversarial loss contributes to reducing over-smoothing of the converted feature sequence. We configure a CycleGAN with gated CNNs and train it with an identity-mapping loss. This allows the mapping function to capture sequential and hierarchical structures while preserving linguistic information. We evaluated our method on a parallel-data-free VC task. An objective evaluation showed that the converted feature sequence was near natural in terms of global variance and modulation spectra. A subjective evaluation showed that the quality of the converted speech was comparable to that obtained with a Gaussian mixture model-based method under advantageous conditions with parallel and twice the amount of data.",

We explore the possibility of creating dialogue data through the interaction between a dialogue system and a user simulator. Our goal is to develop a modelling framework that can incorporate new dialogue scenarios through self-play between the two agents. In this framework, we first pre-train the two agents on a collection of source domain dialogues, which equips the agents to converse with each other via natural language. With further fine-tuning on a small amount of target domain data, the agents continue to interact with the aim of improving their behaviors using reinforcement learning with structured reward functions. In experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, two practical transfer learning problems are investigated: 1) domain adaptation and 2) single-to-multiple domain transfer. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is highly effective in bootstrapping the performance of the two agents in transfer learning. We also show that our method leads to improvements in dialogue system performance on complete datasets.",

As an update to the previous challenge, we considered both parallel and non-parallel data to form the Hub and Spoke tasks, respectively. A total of 23 teams from around the world submitted their systems, 11 of them additionally participated in the optional Spoke task. A large-scale crowdsourced perceptual evaluation was then carried out to rate the submitted converted speech in terms of naturalness and similarity to the target speaker identity. In this paper, we present a brief summary of the state-of-the-art techniques for VC, followed by a detailed explanation of the challenge tasks and the results that were obtained.",

        "content1": "This article proposes a voice conversion (VC) method using sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq or S2S) learning, which flexibly converts not only the voice characteristics but also the pitch contour and duration of input speech. The proposed method, called ConvS2S-VC, has three key features. First, it uses a model with a fully convolutional architecture. This is particularly advantageous in that it is suitable for parallel computations using GPUs. It is also beneficial since it enables effective normalization techniques such as batch normalization to be used for all the hidden layers in the networks. Second, it achieves many-to-many conversion by simultaneously learning mappings among multiple speakers using only a single model instead of separately learning mappings between each speaker pair using a different model. This enables the model to fully utilize available training data collected from multiple speakers by capturing common latent features that can be shared across different speakers. Owing to this structure, our model works reasonably well even without source speaker information, thus making it able to handle any-to-many conversion tasks. Third, we introduce a mechanism, called the conditional batch normalization that switches batch normalization layers in accordance with the target speaker. This particular mechanism has been found to be extremely effective for our many-to-many conversion model. We conducted speaker identity conversion experiments and found that ConvS2S-VC obtained higher sound quality and speaker similarity than baseline methods. We also found from audio examples that it could perform well in various tasks including emotional expression conversion, electrolaryngeal speech enhancement, and English accent conversion.",
        "content2": "Neural implicit 3D representations have emerged as a powerful paradigm for reconstructing surfaces from multi-view images and synthesizing novel views. Unfortunately, existing methods such as DVR or IDR require accurate per-pixel object masks as supervision. At the same time, neural radiance fields have revolutionized novel view synthesis. However, NeRF's estimated volume density does not admit accurate surface reconstruction. Our key insight is that implicit surface models and radiance fields can be formulated in a unified way, enabling both surface and volume rendering using the same model. This unified perspective enables novel, more efficient sampling procedures and the ability to reconstruct accurate surfaces without input masks. We compare our method on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and a synthetic indoor dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that we outperform NeRF in terms of reconstruction quality while performing on par with IDR without requiring masks.",

However, there is still a large gap between the real target and converted speech, and bridging this gap remains a challenge. To reduce the gap, we propose CycleGAN-VC2, which is an improved version of CycleGAN-VC incorporating three new techniques: an improved objective (two-step adversarial losses), improved generator (2-1-2D CNN), and improved discriminator (PatchGAN).

We experiment with 10 different types of perturbations on 4 multi-turn dialog datasets and find that commonly used neural dialog architectures like recurrent and transformer-based seq2seq models are rarely sensitive to most perturbations such as missing or reordering utterances, shuffling words, etc. Also, by open-sourcing our code, we believe that it will serve as a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating dialog systems in the future.",

We present an extension of mip-NeRF (a NeRF variant that addresses sampling and aliasing) that uses a non-linear scene parameterization, online distillation, and a novel distortion-based regularizer to overcome the challenges presented by unbounded scenes. Our model, which we dub \"mip-NeRF 360\" as we target scenes in which the camera rotates 360 degrees around a point, reduces mean-squared error by 57% compared to mip-NeRF, and is able to produce realistic synthesized views and detailed depth maps for highly intricate, unbounded real-world scenes.",

The proposed approach first obtains PPGs of target speech. Then, a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Recurrent Neural Network (DBLSTM) structure is used to model the relationships between the PPGs and acoustic features of the target speech. To convert arbitrary source speech, we obtain its PPGs from the same SI-ASR and feed them into the trained DBLSTM for generating converted speech. Our approach has two main advantages: 1) no parallel training data is required; 2) a trained model can be applied to any other source speaker for a fixed target speaker (i.e., many-to-one conversion).

Automatic metrics such as BLEU correlate weakly with human annotations, resulting in a significant bias across different models and datasets. Some researchers resort to human judgment experimentation for assessing response quality, which is expensive, time consuming, and not scalable. Moreover, judges tend to evaluate a small number of dialogues, meaning that minor differences in evaluation configuration may lead to dissimilar results. In this paper, we present interpretable metrics for evaluating topic coherence by making use of distributed sentence representations. Furthermore, we introduce calculable approximations of human judgment based on conversational coherence by adopting state-of-the-art entailment techniques. Results show that our metrics can be used as a surrogate for human judgment, making it easy to evaluate dialogue systems on large-scale datasets and allowing an unbiased estimate for the quality of the responses.",

In this article we focus on two problems of speech produced with an EL (EL speech). One problem is that EL speech is extremely unnatural and the other is that sound source signals with high energy are generated by an EL, and therefore, the signals often annoy surrounding people. To address these two problems, in this article we propose three speaking-aid systems that enhance three different types of EL speech signals: EL speech, EL speech using an air-pressure sensor (EL-air speech), and silent EL speech. The air-pressure sensor enables a laryngectomee to manipulate the F0 contours of EL speech using exhaled air that flows from the tracheostoma. Silent EL speech is produced with a new sound source unit that generates signals with extremely low energy. Our speaking-aid systems address the poor quality of EL speech using voice conversion (VC), which transforms acoustic features so that it appears as if the speech is uttered by another person. Our systems estimate spectral parameters, F0, and aperiodic components independently. The result of experimental evaluations demonstrates that the use of an air-pressure sensor dramatically improves F0 estimation accuracy. Moreover, it is revealed that the converted speech signals are preferred to source EL speech.",

This study focuses on formulating robust techniques for a codebook mapping based voice conversion algorithm. Three different methods are used to improve voice conversion performance: confidence measures, pre-emphasis, and spectral equalization. Analysis is performed for each method and the implementation details are discussed. The first method employs confidence measures in the training stage to eliminate problematic pairs of source and target speech units that might result from possible misalignments, speaking style differences or pronunciation variations. Four confidence measures are developed based on the spectral distance, fundamental frequency (f0) distance, energy distance, and duration distance between the source and target speech units. The second method focuses on the importance of pre-emphasis in line-spectral frequency (LSF) based vocal tract modeling and transformation. The last method, spectral equalization, is aimed at reducing the differences in the source and target long-term spectra when the source and target recording conditions are significantly different. The voice conversion algorithm that employs the proposed techniques is compared with the baseline voice conversion algorithm with objective tests as well as three subjective listening tests. First, similarity to the target voice is evaluated in a subjective listening test and it is shown that the proposed algorithm improves similarity to the target voice by 23.0%. An ABX test is performed and the proposed algorithm is preferred over the baseline algorithm by 76.4%. In the third test, the two algorithms are compared in terms of the subjective quality of the voice conversion output. The proposed algorithm improves the subjective output quality by 46.8% in terms of mean opinion score (MOS).",

However, the adoption of a persona can result in the adoption of biases. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study on persona biases in dialogue systems and conduct analyses on personas of different social classes, sexual orientations, races, and genders. We define persona biases as harmful differences in responses (e.g., varying levels of offensiveness, agreement with harmful statements) generated from adopting different demographic personas. Furthermore, we introduce an open-source framework, UnitPersonaBias, to explore and aggregate persona biases in dialogue systems. By analyzing the Blender and DialoGPT dialogue systems, we observe that adopting personas can actually decrease harmful responses, compared to not using any personas. Additionally, we find that persona choices can affect the degree of harms in generated responses and thus should be systematically evaluated before deployment. We also analyze how personas can result in different amounts of harm towards specific demographics.",

        "content1": "Recent progress on multi-view 3D object reconstruction has featured neural implicit surfaces via learning high-fidelity radiance fields. However, most approaches hinge on the visual hull derived from cost-expensive silhouette masks to obtain object surfaces. In this paper, we propose a novel Object-aware Radiance Fields (ORF) to automatically learn an object-aware geometry reconstruction. The geometric correspondences between multi-view 2D object regions and 3D implicit/explicit object surfaces are additionally exploited to boost the learning of object surfaces. Technically, a critical transparency discriminator is designed to distinguish the object-intersected and object-bypassed rays based on the estimated 2D object regions, leading to 3D implicit object surfaces. Such implicit surfaces can be directly converted into explicit object surfaces (e.g., meshes) via marching cubes. Then, we build the geometric correspondence between 2D planes and 3D meshes by rasterization, and project the estimated object regions into 3D explicit object surfaces by aggregating the object information across multiple views. The aggregated object information in 3D explicit object surfaces is further reprojected back to 2D planes, aiming to update 2D object regions and enforce them to be multi-view consistent. Extensive experiments on DTU and BlendedMVS verify the capability of ORF to produce comparable surfaces against the state-of-the-art models that demand silhouette masks.",

In this work, we introduce Sparse Pose Adjusting Radiance Field (SPARF), to address the challenge of novel-view synthesis given only few wide-baseline input images (as low as 3) with noisy camera poses. Our approach exploits multi-view geometry constraints in order to jointly learn the NeRF and refine the camera poses. By relying on pixel matches extracted between the input views, our multi-view correspondence objective enforces the optimized scene and camera poses to converge to a global and geometrically accurate solution. Our depth consistency loss further encourages the reconstructed scene to be consistent from any viewpoint.

        "content1": "This paper presents one of the first learning-based NeRF 3D instance segmentation pipelines, dubbed as Instance Neural Radiance Field, or Instance-NeRF. Taking a NeRF pretrained from multi-view RGB images as input, Instance-NeRF can learn 3D instance segmentation of a given scene, represented as an instance field component of the NeRF model. To this end, we adopt a 3D proposal-based mask prediction network on the sampled volumetric features from NeRF, which generates discrete 3D instance masks. The coarse 3D mask prediction is then projected to image space to match 2D segmentation masks from different views generated by existing panoptic segmentation models, which are used to supervise the training of the instance field. Notably, beyond generating consistent 2D segmentation maps from novel views, Instance-NeRF can query instance information at any 3D point, which greatly enhances NeRF object segmentation and manipulation. Our method is also one of the first to achieve such results in pure inference. Experimented on synthetic and real-world NeRF datasets with complex indoor scenes, Instance-NeRF surpasses previous NeRF segmentation works and competitive 2D segmentation methods in segmentation performance on unseen views.

Our method enables pausing the video at any frame and rendering all scene details (dynamic humans, objects, and backgrounds) from arbitrary viewpoints. The first challenge in this task is the complex object motions in human-object interactions, which we tackle by introducing the new object bones into the conventional human skeleton hierarchy to effectively estimate large object deformations in our dynamic human-object model. The second challenge is that humans interact with different objects at different times, for which we introduce two new learnable object state embeddings that can be used as conditions for learning our human-object representation and scene representation, respectively. Extensive experiments show that HOSNeRF significantly outperforms SOTA approaches on two challenging datasets by a large margin of 40%   50% in terms of LPIPS.

We first develop a multi-speaker speech synthesis system with sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder extracts the linguistic representations of input text, while the decoder, conditioned on target speaker embedding, takes the context vectors and the attention recurrent network cell output to generate target acoustic features. We take advantage of the fact that TTS system maps input text to speaker independent context vectors, thus re-purpose such a mapping to supervise the training of the latent representations of an encoder-decoder voice conversion system. In the voice conversion system, the encoder takes speech instead of text as the input, while the decoder is functionally similar to the TTS decoder. As we condition the decoder on a speaker embedding, the system can be trained on non-parallel data for any-to-any voice conversion. During voice conversion training, we present both text and speech to speech synthesis and voice conversion networks respectively. At run-time, the voice conversion network uses its own encoder-decoder architecture without the need of text input. Experiments show that the proposed TTL-VC system outperforms two competitive voice conversion baselines consistently, namely phonetic posteriorgram and AutoVC methods, in terms of speech quality, naturalness, and speaker similarity.",

Many SC frameworks require parallel corpora, phonetic alignments, or explicit frame-wise correspondence for learning conversion functions or for synthesizing a target spectrum with the aid of alignments. However, these requirements gravely limit the scope of practical applications of SC due to scarcity or even unavailability of parallel corpora. We propose an SC framework based on variational auto-encoder which enables us to exploit non-parallel corpora. The framework comprises an encoder that learns speaker-independent phonetic representations and a decoder that learns to reconstruct the designated speaker. It removes the requirement of parallel corpora or phonetic alignments to train a spectral conversion system. We report objective and subjective evaluations to validate our proposed method and compare it to SC methods that have access to aligned corpora.",

NeRFs have been shown to be remarkably effective for the task of view synthesis — synthesizing photorealistic novel views of real-world scenes or objects. In this work, we investigate whether we can apply analysis-by-synthesis via NeRF for mesh-free, RGB-only 6DoF pose estimation – given an image, find the translation and rotation of a camera relative to a 3D object or scene. Our method assumes that no object mesh models are available during either training or test time. Starting from an initial pose estimate, we use gradient descent to minimize the residual between pixels rendered from a NeRF and pixels in an observed image. In our experiments, we first study 1) how to sample rays during pose refinement for iNeRF to collect informative gradients and 2) how different batch sizes of rays affect iNeRF on a synthetic dataset. We then show that for complex real-world scenes from the LLFF dataset [21], iNeRF can improve NeRF by estimating the camera poses of novel images and using these images as additional training data for NeRF. Finally, we show iNeRF can perform categorylevel object pose estimation, including object instances not seen during training, with RGB images by inverting a NeRF model inferred from a single view.",

Although conventional VC can be built from non-parallel data, it is difficult to convert speaker individuality such as phonetic property and speaking rate contained in the posterior probabilities because the source posterior probabilities are directly used for predicting target speech parameters. In this work, we assume that the training data partly include parallel speech data and propose sequence-to-sequence learning between the source and target posterior probabilities. The conversion models perform non-linear and variable-length transformation from the source probability sequence to the target one. Further, we propose a joint training algorithm for the modules. In contrast to conventional VC, which separately trains the speech recognition that estimates posterior probabilities and the speech synthesis that predicts target speech parameters, our proposed method jointly trains these modules along with the proposed probability conversion modules. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the conventional VC.",

The proposed network is not conditioned on the text or on the notes, and it directly converts the audio of one singer to the voice of another. Training is performed without any form of supervision: no lyrics or any kind of phonetic features, no notes, and no matching samples between singers. The proposed network employs a single CNN encoder for all singers, a single WaveNet decoder, and a classifier that enforces the latent representation to be singer-agnostic. Each singer is represented by one embedding vector, which the decoder is conditioned on. In order to deal with relatively small datasets, we propose a new data augmentation scheme, as well as new training losses and protocols that are based on backtranslation. Our evaluation presents evidence that the conversion produces natural signing voices that are highly recognizable as the target singer.",

Spectral parameters are mapped using a locally linear transformation based on Gaussian mixture models whose parameters are trained by joint density estimation. The LPC residuals are adjusted to match the target speakers average pitch. To study effects of the amount of training on performance, data sets of varying sizes are created by automatically selecting subsets of all available diphones by a vector quantization method. In an objective evaluation, the proposed method is found to perform more reliably for small training sets than a previous approach. In perceptual tests, it was shown that nearly optimal spectral conversion performance was achieved, even with a small amount of training data.

Although conventional VC can be built from non-parallel data, it is difficult to convert speaker individuality such as phonetic property and speaking rate contained in the posterior probabilities because the source posterior probabilities are directly used for predicting target speech parameters. In this work, we assume that the training data partly include parallel speech data and propose sequence-to-sequence learning between the source and target posterior probabilities. The conversion models perform non-linear and variable-length transformation from the source probability sequence to the target one. Further, we propose a joint training algorithm for the modules. In contrast to conventional VC, which separately trains the speech recognition that estimates posterior probabilities and the speech synthesis that predicts target speech parameters, our proposed method jointly trains these modules along with the proposed probability conversion modules. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the conventional VC.",

Developers of the modern conversation systems show they deploy a variety of techniques to initiate and maintain dialogue learning from interactions with humans over the Internet. Statistical significance shows these dialogue systems are an improvement on their predecessor. Embedded on the web affording round-the-clock interaction the nature of artificial dialogue systems is evolving as these systems learn from the way humans converse. The uses of modern Elizas are proven successful as virtual assistants in e-commerce; their conversational basis is already extending into education.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) represent continuous volumetric density and RGB values in a neural network, and generate photo-realistic images from unseen camera viewpoints through ray tracing. We propose an algorithm for navigating a robot through a 3D environment represented as a NeRF using only an onboard RGB camera for localization. We assume the NeRF for the scene has been pre-trained offline, and the robot&#x2019;s objective is to navigate through unoccupied space in the NeRF to reach a goal pose. We introduce a trajectory optimization algorithm that avoids collisions with high-density regions in the NeRF based on a discrete time version of differential flatness that is amenable to constraining the robot&#x2019;s full pose and control inputs. We also introduce an optimization based filtering method to estimate 6DoF pose and velocities for the robot in the NeRF given only an onboard RGB camera. We combine the trajectory planner with the pose filter in an online replanning loop to give a vision-based robot navigation pipeline. We present simulation results with a quadrotor robot navigating through a jungle gym environment, the inside of a church, and Stonehenge using only an RGB camera.

In this paper, we propose a modification of the conventional training process for VC that allows it to perform as an AC transform. Namely, we pair source and target vectors based not on their ordering within a parallel corpus, as is commonly done in VC, but based on their linguistic similarity. We validate the approach on a corpus containing native-accented and Spanish-accented utterances, and compare it against conventional VC through a series of listening tests.

Our system uses a pre-trained NeRF model as the map of an environment and can localize itself in real-time using an RGB camera as the only exteroceptive sensor onboard the robot. While neural radiance fields have seen significant applications for visual rendering in computer vision and graphics, they have found limited use in robotics. Existing approaches for NeRF-based localization require both a good initial pose guess and significant computation, making them impractical for real-time robotics applications. By using Monte Carlo localization as a workhorse to estimate poses using a NeRF map model, LocNeRF is able to perform localization faster than the state of the art and without relying on an initial pose estimate. In addition to testing on synthetic data, we also run our system using real data collected by a Clearpath Jackal UGV and demonstrate for the first time the ability to perform real-time and global localization (albeit over a small workspace) with neural radiance fields.

The model is optimized in an end-to-end fashion without any manual supervision, such as lyrics, musical notes or parallel samples.

In this paper, we present the first large-scale study on persona biases in dialogue systems and conduct analyses on personas of different social classes, sexual orientations, races, and genders. We define persona biases as harmful differences in responses (e.g., varying levels of offensiveness, agreement with harmful statements) generated from adopting different demographic personas. Furthermore, we introduce an open-source framework, UnitPersonaBias, to explore and aggregate persona biases in dialogue systems. By analyzing the Blender and DialoGPT dialogue systems, we observe that adopting personas can actually decrease harmful responses, compared to not using any personas. Additionally, we find that persona choices can affect the degree of harms in generated responses and thus should be systematically evaluated before deployment. We also analyze how personas can result in different amounts of harm towards specific demographics.",

        "content1": "Generating complex multi-turn goal-oriented dialogue agents is a difficult problem that has seen a considerable focus from many leaders in the tech industry, including IBM, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. This is in large part due to the rapidly growing market demand for dialogue agents capable of goal-oriented behaviour. Due to the business process nature of these conversations, end-to-end machine learning systems are generally not a viable option, as the generated dialogue agents must be deployable and verifiable on behalf of the businesses authoring them.\n  In this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the creation of goal-oriented complex dialogue systems that dramatically eliminates the need for a designer to manually specify a dialogue tree, which nearly all current systems have to resort to when the interaction pattern falls outside standard patterns such as slot filling. We propose a declarative representation of the dialogue agent to be processed by state-of-the-art planning technology. Our proposed approach covers all aspects of the process; from model solicitation to the execution of the generated plans/dialogue agents. Along the way, we introduce novel planning encodings for declarative dialogue synthesis, a variety of interfaces for working with the specification as a dialogue architect, and a robust executor for generalized contingent plans. We have created prototype implementations of all components, and in this paper, we further demonstrate the resulting system empirically.",

The input source signal is decomposed into the source exemplars, noise exemplars obtained from the input signal, and their weights (activities). Then, by using the weights of the source exemplars, the converted signal is constructed from the target exemplars. We carried out speaker conversion tasks using clean speech data and noise-added speech data. The effectiveness of this method was confirmed by comparing its effectiveness with that of a conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based method.",

A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of the joint probability density of source and target features is employed for performing spectral conversion between speakers. The conventional method converts spectral parameters frame by frame based on the minimum mean square error. Although it is reasonably effective, the deterioration of speech quality is caused by some problems: 1) appropriate spectral movements are not always caused by the frame-based conversion process, and 2) the converted spectra are excessively smoothed by statistical modeling. In order to address those problems, we propose a conversion method based on the maximum-likelihood estimation of a spectral parameter trajectory. Not only static but also dynamic feature statistics are used for realizing the appropriate converted spectrum sequence. Moreover, the oversmoothing effect is alleviated by considering a global variance feature of the converted spectra. Experimental results indicate that the performance of VC can be dramatically improved by the proposed method in view of both speech quality and conversion accuracy for speaker individuality.",

In EVC, emotions are usually treated as discrete categories overlooking the fact that speech also conveys emotions with various intensity levels that the listener can perceive. In this paper, we aim to explicitly characterize and control the intensity of emotion. We propose to disentangle the speaker style from linguistic content and encode the speaker style into a style embedding in a continuous space that forms the prototype of emotion embedding. We further learn the actual emotion encoder from an emotion-labelled database and study the use of relative attributes to represent fine-grained emotion intensity. To ensure emotional intelligibility, we incorporate \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">emotion classification loss</i>\n and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">emotion embedding similarity loss</i>\n into the training of the EVC network.

        "content1": "Purely MLP-based neural radiance fields (NeRF-based methods) often suffer from underfitting with blurred renderings on large-scale scenes due to limited model capacity. Recent approaches propose to geographically divide the scene and adopt multiple sub-NeRFs to model each region individually, leading to linear scale-up in training costs and the number of sub-NeRFs as the scene expands. An alternative solution is to use a feature grid representation, which is computationally efficient and can naturally scale to a large scene with increased grid resolutions. However, the feature grid tends to be less constrained and often reaches suboptimal solutions, producing noisy artifacts in renderings, especially in regions with complex geometry and texture. In this work, we present a new framework that realizes high-fidelity rendering on large urban scenes while being computationally efficient. We propose to use a compact multi-resolution ground feature plane representation to coarsely capture the scene, and complement it with positional encoding inputs through another NeRF branch for rendering in a joint learning fashion. We show that such an integration can utilize the advantages of two alternative solutions: a light-weighted NeRF is sufficient, under the guidance of the feature grid representation, to render photorealistic novel views with fine details; and the jointly optimized ground feature planes, can meanwhile gain further refinements, forming a more accurate and compact feature space and output much more natural rendering results.",

We first develop a multi-speaker speech synthesis system with sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder extracts the linguistic representations of input text, while the decoder, conditioned on target speaker embedding, takes the context vectors and the attention recurrent network cell output to generate target acoustic features. We take advantage of the fact that TTS system maps input text to speaker independent context vectors, thus re-purpose such a mapping to supervise the training of the latent representations of an encoder-decoder voice conversion system. In the voice conversion system, the encoder takes speech instead of text as the input, while the decoder is functionally similar to the TTS decoder. As we condition the decoder on a speaker embedding, the system can be trained on non-parallel data for any-to-any voice conversion. During voice conversion training, we present both text and speech to speech synthesis and voice conversion networks respectively. At run-time, the voice conversion network uses its own encoder-decoder architecture without the need of text input.

        "content1": "This paper proposes a non-parallel voice conversion (VC) method using a variant of the conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) called an auxiliary classifier VAE. The proposed method has two key features. First, it adopts fully convolutional architectures to construct the encoder and decoder networks so that the networks can learn conversion rules that capture the time dependencies in the acoustic feature sequences of source and target speech. Second, it uses information-theoretic regularization for the model training to ensure that the information in the attribute class label will not be lost in the conversion process. With regular conditional VAEs, the encoder and decoder are free to ignore the attribute class label input. This can be problematic since in such a situation, the attribute class label will have little effect on controlling the voice characteristics of input speech at test time. Such situations can be avoided by introducing an auxiliary classifier and training the encoder and decoder so that the attribute classes of the decoder outputs are correctly predicted by the classifier. We also present several ways to convert the feature sequence of input speech using the trained encoder and decoder and compare them in terms of audio quality through objective and subjective evaluations. We confirmed experimentally that the proposed method outperformed baseline non-parallel VC systems and performed comparably to an open-source parallel VC system trained using a parallel corpus in a speaker identity conversion task.",

We conduct a between-subjects study to understand the impact of four experiment conditions on human ratings of dialogue system output. In addition to discrete and continuous scale ratings, we also experiment with a novel application of Best-Worst scaling to dialogue evaluation. Through our systematic study with 40 crowdsourced workers in each task, we find that using continuous scales achieves more consistent ratings than Likert scale or ranking-based experiment design.

From the results of crowd-sourced listening tests, we observed that VC methods have progressed rapidly thanks to advanced deep learning methods. In particular, speaker similarity scores of several systems turned out to be as high as target speakers in the intra-lingual semi-parallel VC task. However, we confirmed that none of them have achieved human-level naturalness yet for the same task. The cross-lingual conversion task is, as expected, a more difficult task, and the overall naturalness and similarity scores were lower than those for the intra-lingual conversion task. However, we observed encouraging results, and the MOS scores of the best systems were higher than 4.0.

Taking a NeRF pretrained from multi-view RGB images as input, Instance-NeRF can learn 3D instance segmentation of a given scene, represented as an instance field component of the NeRF model. To this end, we adopt a 3D proposal-based mask prediction network on the sampled volumetric features from NeRF, which generates discrete 3D instance masks. The coarse 3D mask prediction is then projected to image space to match 2D segmentation masks from different views generated by existing panoptic segmentation models, which are used to supervise the training of the instance field. Notably, beyond generating consistent 2D segmentation maps from novel views, Instance-NeRF can query instance information at any 3D point, which greatly enhances NeRF object segmentation and manipulation. Our method is also one of the first to achieve such results in pure inference. Experimented on synthetic and real-world NeRF datasets with complex indoor scenes, Instance-NeRF surpasses previous NeRF segmentation works and competitive 2D segmentation methods in segmentation performance on unseen views.

        "content1": "Dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a powerful algorithm capable of rendering photo-realistic novel view images from a monocular RGB video of a dynamic scene. Although it warps moving points across frames from the observation spaces to a common canonical space for rendering, dynamic NeRF does not model the change of the reflected color during the warping. As a result, this approach often fails drastically on challenging specular objects in motion. We address this limitation by reformulating the neural radiance field function to be conditioned on surface position and orientation in the observation space. This allows the specular surface at different poses to keep the different reflected colors when mapped to the common canonical space. Additionally, we add the mask of moving objects to guide the deformation field. As the specular surface changes color during motion, the mask mitigates the problem of failure to find temporal correspondences with only RGB supervision. We evaluate our model based on the novel view synthesis quality with a self-collected dataset of different moving specular objects in realistic environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the reconstruction quality of moving specular objects from monocular RGB videos compared to the existing NeRF models.

Unlike previous approaches that either lack sufficient geometry deformations and texture details or require meshes to guide the stylization, our method can shift a 3D scene to the target style characterized by desired geometry and appearance variations without any mesh guidance. This is achieved by introducing a novel global-local contrastive learning strategy, combined with the directional constraint to simultaneously control both the trajectory and the strength of the target style. Moreover, we adopt a weight regularization method to effectively suppress cloudy artifacts and geometry noises which arise easily when the density field is transformed during geometry stylization.

In order to remove the need to define such summary spaces, we show that deep RL can also be trained efficiently on the original state and action spaces. Dialogue systems based on partially observable Markov decision processes are known to require many dialogues to train, which makes them unappealing for practical deployment. We show that a deep RL method based on an actor-critic architecture can exploit a small amount of data very efficiently. Indeed, with only a few hundred dialogues collected with a handcrafted policy, the actor-critic deep learner is considerably bootstrapped from a combination of supervised and batch RL. In addition, convergence to an optimal policy is significantly sped up compared to other deep RL methods initialized on the data with batch RL.

During inference, it only takes a few RGB views (i.e., few-shot) of an unseen 3D object instance within the known category to infer the object part segmentation and the neural radiance field. Given an articulated pose as input, CLA-NeRF can perform articulation-aware volume rendering to generate the corresponding RGB image at any camera pose. Moreover, the articulated pose of an object can be estimated via inverse rendering. In our experiments, we evaluate the framework across five categories on both synthetic and real-world data.

In this setting, existing NeRF-like models often produce blurry or low-resolution renderings (due to the unbalanced detail and scale of nearby and distant objects), are slow to train, and may exhibit artifacts due to the inherent ambiguity of the task of reconstructing a large scene from a small set of images. We present an extension of mip-NeRF (a NeRF variant that addresses sampling and aliasing) that uses a non-linear scene parameterization, online distillation, and a novel distortion-based regularizer to overcome the challenges presented by unbounded scenes. Our model, which we dub \"mip-NeRF 360\" as we target scenes in which the camera rotates 360 degrees around a point, reduces mean-squared error by 57% compared to mip-NeRF, and is able to produce realistic synthesized views and detailed depth maps for highly intricate, unbounded real-world scenes.",

        "content1": "This paper proposes an any-to-many location-relative, sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq), non-parallel voice conversion approach, which utilizes text supervision during training. In this approach, we combine a bottle-neck feature extractor (BNE) with a seq2seq synthesis module. During the training stage, an encoder-decoder-based hybrid connectionist-temporal-classification-attention (CTC-attention) phoneme recognizer is trained, whose encoder has a bottle-neck layer. A BNE is obtained from the phoneme recognizer and is utilized to extract speaker-independent, dense and rich spoken content representations from spectral features. Then a multi-speaker location-relative attention based seq2seq synthesis model is trained to reconstruct spectral features from the bottle-neck features, conditioning on speaker representations for speaker identity control in the generated speech. To mitigate the difficulties of using seq2seq models to align long sequences, we down-sample the input spectral feature along the temporal dimension and equip the synthesis model with a discretized mixture of logistic (MoL) attention mechanism. Since the phoneme recognizer is trained with large speech recognition data corpus, the proposed approach can conduct any-to-many voice conversion.

The input source signal is decomposed into the source exemplars, noise exemplars obtained from the input signal, and their weights (activities). Then, by using the weights of the source exemplars, the converted signal is constructed from the target exemplars.

In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches that model the geometry and material properties explicitly, or are purely image-based, we introduce an implicit representation of the head based on scene representation networks. To handle the dynamics of the face, we combine our scene representation network with a low-dimensional morphable model which provides explicit control over pose and expressions. We use volumetric rendering to generate images from this hybrid representation and demonstrate that such a dynamic neural scene representation can be learned from monocular input data only, without the need of a specialized capture setup. In our experiments, we show that this learned volumetric representation allows for photorealistic image generation that surpasses the quality of state-of-the-art video-based reenactment methods.",

This is why we report in this paper the first known attempt to perform adversarial attack on voice conversion. We introduce human imperceptible noise into the utterances of a speaker whose voice is to be defended. Given these adversarial examples, voice conversion models cannot convert other utterances so as to sound like being produced by the defended speaker. Preliminary experiments were conducted on two currently state-of-the-art zero-shot voice conversion models. Objective and subjective evaluation results in both white-box and black-box scenarios are reported.

Previous works focus on reducing the dimension of speech to get the content information. But the size is hard to determine to lead to the untangle overlapping problem. We propose the Disentangled Representation Voice Conversion (DRVC) model to address the issue.

        "content1": "Dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a powerful algorithm capable of rendering photo-realistic novel view images from a monocular RGB video of a dynamic scene. Although it warps moving points across frames from the observation spaces to a common canonical space for rendering, dynamic NeRF does not model the change of the reflected color during the warping. As a result, this approach often fails drastically on challenging specular objects in motion. We address this limitation by reformulating the neural radiance field function to be conditioned on surface position and orientation in the observation space. This allows the specular surface at different poses to keep the different reflected colors when mapped to the common canonical space. Additionally, we add the mask of moving objects to guide the deformation field. As the specular surface changes color during motion, the mask mitigates the problem of failure to find temporal correspondences with only RGB supervision. We evaluate our model based on the novel view synthesis quality with a self-collected dataset of different moving specular objects in realistic environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the reconstruction quality of moving specular objects from monocular RGB videos compared to the existing NeRF models.

In particular, we estimate the human pose for each frame and learn a constant canonical space for the detailed human template, which enables natural shape deformation from the observation space to the canonical space under the explicit control of the pose parameters. To compensate for inaccurate pose estimation, we introduce the pose refinement strategy that updates the initial pose during the learning process, which not only helps to learn more accurate human reconstruction but also accelerates the convergence.

To address these issues, we propose NeRF-MS, a novel approach to training NeRF with multi-sequence data. Specifically, we utilize a triplet loss to regularize the distribution of per-image appearance code, which leads to better high-frequency texture and consistent appearance, such as specular reflections. Then, we explicitly model non-static objects to reduce floaters.

Several studies have attempted to mitigate this problem by integrating Multi-View Stereo (MVS) technique into NeRF while they still entail a cumbersome fine-tuning process for new scenes. Notably, the rendering quality will drop severely without this fine-tuning process and the errors mainly appear around the high-frequency features. In the light of this observation, we design WaveNeRF, which integrates wavelet frequency decomposition into MVS and NeRF to achieve generalizable yet high-quality synthesis without any per-scene optimization. To preserve high-frequency information when generating 3D feature volumes, WaveNeRF builds Multi-View Stereo in the Wavelet domain by integrating the discrete wavelet transform into the classical cascade MVS, which disentangles high-frequency information explicitly. With that, disentangled frequency features can be injected into classic NeRF via a novel hybrid neural renderer to yield faithful high-frequency details, and an intuitive frequency-guided sampling strategy can be designed to suppress artifacts around high-frequency regions. Extensive experiments over three widely studied benchmarks show that WaveNeRF achieves superior generalizable radiance field modeling when only given three images as input.",

It is still a challenging work, especially in a one-shot setting. Auto-encoder-based VC methods disentangle the speaker and the content in input speech without given the speaker's identity, so these methods can further generalize to unseen speakers. The disentangle capability is achieved by vector quantization (VQ), adversarial training, or instance normalization (IN). However, the imperfect disentanglement may harm the quality of output speech. In this work, to further improve audio quality, we use the U-Net architecture within an auto-encoder-based VC system. We find that to leverage the U-Net architecture, a strong information bottleneck is necessary. The VQ-based method, which quantizes the latent vectors, can serve the purpose. The objective and the subjective evaluations show that the proposed method performs well in both audio naturalness and speaker similarity.",

Then we design a pose-driven deformation field to establish correspondence from those different poses to a shared canonical space, where a pose-disentangled NeRF for one hand is optimized. Such unified modeling efficiently complements the geometry and texture cues in rarely-observed areas for both hands. Meanwhile, we further leverage the pose priors to generate pseudo depth maps as guidance for occlusion-aware density learning. Moreover, a neural feature distillation method is proposed to achieve cross-domain alignment for color optimization.

Moreover, we implement and compare multiple existing continual learning baselines, and we propose a simple yet effective architectural method based on residual adapters. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed architectural method and a simple replay-based strategy perform comparably well but they both achieve inferior performance to the multi-task learning baseline, in where all the data are shown at once, showing that continual learning in task-oriented dialogue systems is a challenging task. Furthermore, we reveal several trade-offs between different continual learning methods in term of parameter usage and memory size, which are important in the design of a task-oriented dialogue system.

Points in the 4D space are associated with probabilities of belonging to three categories: static, deforming, and new areas. Each area is represented and regularized by a separate neural field. Second, we propose a hybrid representations based feature streaming scheme for efficiently modeling the neural fields. Our approach, coined NeRFPlayer, is evaluated on dynamic scenes captured by single hand-held cameras and multi-camera arrays, achieving comparable or superior rendering performance in terms of quality and speed comparable to recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving reconstruction in 10 seconds per frame and interactive rendering.

In our setting, each individual MLP only needs to represent parts of the scene, thus smaller and faster-to-evaluate MLPs can be used. By combining this divide-and-conquer strategy with further optimizations, rendering is accelerated by three orders of magnitude compared to the original NeRF model without incurring high storage costs.

        "content1": "In this letter, we tackle the problem of active robotic 3D reconstruction of an object. In particular, we study how a mobile robot with an arm-held camera can select a favorable number of views to recover an object's 3D shape efficiently. Contrary to the existing solution to this problem, we leverage the popular neural radiance fields-based object representation, which has recently shown impressive results for various computer vision tasks. However, it is not straightforward to directly reason about an object's explicit 3D geometric details using such a representation, making the next-best-view selection problem for dense 3D reconstruction challenging. This paper introduces a ray-based volumetric uncertainty estimator, which computes the entropy of the weight distribution of the color samples along each ray of the object's implicit neural representation. We show that it is possible to infer the uncertainty of the underlying 3D geometry given a novel view with the proposed estimator. We then present a next-best-view selection policy guided by the ray-based volumetric uncertainty in neural radiance fields-based representations. Encouraging experimental results on synthetic and real-world data suggest that the approach presented in this paper can enable a new research direction of using an implicit 3D object representation for the next-best-view problem in robot vision applications, distinguishing our approach from the existing approaches that rely on explicit 3D geometric modeling.",

Given a sequence of posed RGB images and lidar sweeps acquired by cameras and scanners moving through an outdoor scene, we produce a model from which 3D surfaces can be extracted and novel RGB images can be synthesized. Our approach extends Neural Radiance Fields, which has been demonstrated to synthesize realistic novel images for small scenes in controlled settings, with new methods for leveraging asynchronously captured lidar data, for addressing exposure variation between captured images, and for leveraging predicted image segmentations to supervise densities on rays pointing at the sky. Each of these three extensions provides significant performance improvements in experiments on Street View data. Our system produces state-of-the-art 3D surface reconstructions and synthesizes higher quality novel views in comparison to both traditional methods (e.g. COLMAP) and recent neural representations (e.g. Mip-NeRF).",

This is in large part due to the rapidly growing market demand for dialogue agents capable of goal-oriented behaviour. Due to the business process nature of these conversations, end-to-end machine learning systems are generally not a viable option, as the generated dialogue agents must be deployable and verifiable on behalf of the businesses authoring them.\n  In this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the creation of goal-oriented complex dialogue systems that dramatically eliminates the need for a designer to manually specify a dialogue tree, which nearly all current systems have to resort to when the interaction pattern falls outside standard patterns such as slot filling. We propose a declarative representation of the dialogue agent to be processed by state-of-the-art planning technology. Our proposed approach covers all aspects of the process; from model solicitation to the execution of the generated plans/dialogue agents. Along the way, we introduce novel planning encodings for declarative dialogue synthesis, a variety of interfaces for working with the specification as a dialogue architect, and a robust executor for generalized contingent plans.

Our algorithm starts from the separate training of one RTRBM for a source speaker and another for a target speaker using speaker-dependent training data. Because each RTRBM attempts to discover abstractions to maximally express the training data at each time step, as well as the temporal dependencies in the training data, we expect that the models represent the linguistic-related latent features in high-order spaces. In our approach, we convert (match) features of emphasis for the source speaker to those of the target speaker using a neural network (NN), so that the entire network (consisting of the two RTRBMs and the NN) acts as a deep recurrent NN and can be fine-tuned.

        "content1": "Voice conversion methods based on frequency warping followed by amplitude scaling have been recently proposed. These methods modify the frequency axis of the source spectrum in such manner that some significant parts of it, usually the formants, are moved towards their image in the target speaker's spectrum. Amplitude scaling is then applied to compensate for the differences between warped source spectra and target spectra. This article presents a fully parametric formulation of a frequency warping plus amplitude scaling method in which bilinear frequency warping functions are used. Introducing this constraint allows for the conversion error to be described in the cepstral domain and to minimize it with respect to the parameters of the transformation through an iterative algorithm, even when multiple overlapping conversion classes are considered. The paper explores the advantages and limitations of this approach when applied to a cepstral representation of speech. We show that it achieves significant improvements in quality with respect to traditional methods based on Gaussian mixture models, with no loss in average conversion accuracy. Despite its relative simplicity, it achieves similar performance scores to state-of-the-art statistical methods involving dynamic features and global variance.",

        "content1": "This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing an animatable human model from a multi-view video. Some recent works have proposed to decompose a non-rigidly deforming scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of deformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space, thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field, which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these representations cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we introduce neural blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based on the skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human skeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can regularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend weight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new deformation fields to animate the human model. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent human synthesis methods.

While full control over viewpoint is achieved, scene lighting is typically \"baked\" into the model and cannot be changed; other methods only capture limited variation in lighting or make restrictive assumptions about the captured scene. These limitations prevent the application on arbitrary materials and novel 3D environments with complex, distinct lighting. In this paper, we target the application scenario of capturing high-fidelity assets for neural relighting in controlled studio conditions, but without requiring a dense light stage. Instead, we leverage a small number of area lights commonly used in photogrammetry. We propose ReNeRF, a relightable radiance field model based on the intuitive and powerful approach of image-based relighting, which implicitly captures global light transport (for arbitrary objects) without complex, error-prone simulations. Thus, our new method is simple and provides full control over viewpoint and lighting, without simplistic assumptions about how light interacts with the scene. In addition, ReNeRF does not rely on the usual assumption of distant lighting - during training, we explicitly account for the distance between 3D points in the volume and point samples on the light sources. Thus, at test time, we achieve better generalization to novel, continuous lighting directions, including nearfield lighting effects.",

Using the HDR-NeRF, we are able to generate both novel HDR views and novel LDR views under different exposures. The key to our method is to model the physical imaging process, which dictates that the radiance of a scene point transforms to a pixel value in the LDR image with two implicit functions: a radiance field and a tone mapper. The radiance field encodes the scene radiance (values vary from 0 to +infty), which outputs the density and radiance of a ray by giving corresponding ray origin and ray direction. The tone mapper models the mapping process that a ray hitting on the camera sensor becomes a pixel value. The color of the ray is predicted by feeding the radiance and the corresponding exposure time into the tone mapper. We use the classic volume rendering technique to project the output radiance, colors, and densities into HDR and LDR images, while only the input LDR images are used as the supervision. We collect a new forward-facing HDR dataset to evaluate the proposed method.

Specifically, existing NeRF-based methods face several limitations when reconstructing high-resolution real scenes, including a very large number of parameters, misaligned input data, and overly smooth details. In this work, we conduct the first pilot study on training NeRF with high-resolution data and propose the corresponding solutions: 1) marrying the multilayer perceptron (MLP) with convolutional layers which can encode more neighborhood information while reducing the total number of parameters; 2) a novel training strategy to address misalignment caused by moving objects or small camera calibration errors; and 3) a high-frequency aware loss.

In this study, we present PPTOD, a unified plug-and-play model for task-oriented dialogue. In addition, we introduce a new dialogue multi-task pre-training strategy that allows the model to learn the primary TOD task completion skills from heterogeneous dialog corpora. We extensively test our model on three benchmark TOD tasks, including end-to-end dialogue modelling, dialogue state tracking, and intent classification. Experimental results show that PPTOD achieves new state of the art on all evaluated tasks in both high-resource and low-resource scenarios. Furthermore, comparisons against previous SOTA methods show that the responses generated by PPTOD are more factually correct and semantically coherent as judged by human annotators.",
        "content2": "Neural volumetric representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a compelling technique for learning to represent 3D scenes from images with the goal of rendering photorealistic images of the scene from unobserved viewpoints. However, NeRF's computational requirements are prohibitive for real-time applications: rendering views from a trained NeRF requires querying a multilayer perceptron (MLP) hundreds of times per ray. We present a method to train a NeRF, then precompute and store (i.e. \"\"bake\"\") it as a novel representation called a Sparse Neural Radiance Grid (SNeRG) that enables real-time rendering on commodity hardware. To achieve this, we introduce 1) a reformulation of NeRF's architecture, and 2) a sparse voxel grid representation with learned feature vectors. The resulting scene representation retains NeRF's ability to render fine geometric details and view-dependent appearance, is compact (averaging less than 90 MB per scene), and can be rendered in real-time (higher than 30 frames per second on a laptop GPU). Actual screen captures are shown in our video.",

The task is especially appealing when only a few or even single RGB cameras are used for capturing the dynamic scene. To this end, we present an efficient framework capable of fast reconstruction, compact modeling, and streamable rendering. First, we propose to decompose the 4D spatiotemporal space according to temporal characteristics. Points in the 4D space are associated with probabilities of belonging to three categories: static, deforming, and new areas. Each area is represented and regularized by a separate neural field. Second, we propose a hybrid representations based feature streaming scheme for efficiently modeling the neural fields. Our approach, coined NeRFPlayer, is evaluated on dynamic scenes captured by single hand-held cameras and multi-camera arrays, achieving comparable or superior rendering performance in terms of quality and speed comparable to recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving reconstruction in 10 seconds per frame and interactive rendering.

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has gained considerable attention recently for 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis due to its remarkable synthesis quality. However, image blurriness caused by defocus or motion, which often occurs when capturing scenes in the wild, significantly degrades its reconstruction quality. To address this problem, We propose Deblur-NeRF, the first method that can recover a sharp NeRF from blurry input. We adopt an analysis-by-synthesis approach that reconstructs blurry views by simulating the blurring process, thus making NeRF robust to blurry inputs. The core of this simulation is a novel Deformable Sparse Kernel (DSK) module that models spatially-varying blur kernels by deforming a canonical sparse kernel at each spatial location. The ray origin of each kernel point is jointly optimized, inspired by the physical blurring process. This module is parameterized as an MLP that has the ability to be generalized to various blur types. Jointly optimizing the NeRF and the DSK module allows us to restore a sharp NeRF. We demonstrate that our method can be used on both camera motion blur and defocus blur: the two most common types of blur in real scenes. Evaluation results on both synthetic and real-world data show that our method outperforms several baselines. The synthetic and real datasets along with the source code can be find in https://limacv.github.io/deblurnerf/",

In this work, we introduce a new resource, not to authoritatively resolve moral ambiguities, but instead to facilitate systematic understanding of the intuitions, values and moral judgments reflected in the utterances of dialogue systems. The Moral Integrity Corpus, MIC, is such a resource, which captures the moral assumptions of 38k prompt-reply pairs, using 99k distinct Rules of Thumb (RoTs). Each RoT reflects a particular moral conviction that can explain why a chatbot's reply may appear acceptable or problematic.

Most importantly, we show that current neural language models can automatically generate new RoTs that reasonably describe previously unseen interactions, but they still struggle with certain scenarios.

In this work we study various model architectures and different ways to represent and aggregate the source information in an end-to-end neural dialogue system framework. A method called snapshot learning is also proposed to facilitate learning from supervised sequential signals by applying a companion cross-entropy objective function to the conditioning vector. The experimental and analytical results demonstrate firstly that competition occurs between the conditioning vector and the LM, and the differing architectures provide different trade-offs between the two. Secondly, the discriminative power and transparency of the conditioning vector is key to providing both model interpretability and better performance. Thirdly, snapshot learning leads to consistent performance improvements independent of which architecture is used.",

        "content1": "In this paper, we present a novel technique for a non-parallel voice conversion (VC) with the use of cyclic variational autoencoder (CycleVAE)-based spectral modeling. In a variational autoencoder(VAE) framework, a latent space, usually with a Gaussian prior, is used to encode a set of input features. In a VAE-based VC, the encoded latent features are fed into a decoder, along with speaker-coding features, to generate estimated spectra with either the original speaker identity (reconstructed) or another speaker identity (converted). Due to the non-parallel modeling condition, the converted spectra can not be directly optimized, which heavily degrades the performance of a VAE-based VC. In this work, to overcome this problem, we propose to use CycleVAE-based spectral model that indirectly optimizes the conversion flow by recycling the converted features back into the system to obtain corresponding cyclic reconstructed spectra that can be directly optimized. The cyclic flow can be continued by using the cyclic reconstructed features as input for the next cycle. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CycleVAE-based VC, which yields higher accuracy of converted spectra, generates latent features with higher correlation degree, and significantly improves the quality and conversion accuracy of the converted speech.",

Most approaches assume optimal illumination and slow camera motion. These assumptions are often violated in robotic applications, where images may contain motion blur, and the scene may not have suitable illumination. This can cause significant problems for downstream tasks such as navigation, inspection, or visualization of the scene. To alleviate these problems, we present E-NeRF, the first method which estimates a volumetric scene representation in the form of a NeRF from a fast-moving event camera. Our method can recover NeRFs during very fast motion and in high-dynamic-range conditions where frame-based approaches fail. We show that rendering high-quality frames is possible by only providing an event stream as input. Furthermore, by combining events and frames, we can estimate NeRFs of higher quality than state-of-the-art approaches under severe motion blur. We also show that combining events and frames can overcome failure cases of NeRF estimation in scenarios where only a few input views are available without requiring additional regularization.",

We show that a single handheld consumer-grade camera is sufficient to synthesize sophisticated renderings of a dynamic scene from novel virtual camera views, e.g. a `bullet-time' video effect. NR-NeRF disentangles the dynamic scene into a canonical volume and its deformation. Scene deformation is implemented as ray bending, where straight rays are deformed non-rigidly. We also propose a novel rigidity network to better constrain rigid regions of the scene, leading to more stable results. The ray bending and rigidity network are trained without explicit supervision. Our formulation enables dense correspondence estimation across views and time, and compelling video editing applications such as motion exaggeration. Our code will be open sourced.",

Existing fast grid-based NeRF training frameworks, like Instant-NGP, Plenoxels, DVGO, or TensoRF, are mainly designed for bounded scenes and rely on space warping to handle unbounded scenes. Existing two widely-used space-warping methods are only designed for the forward-facing trajectory or the 360deg object-centric trajectory but cannot process arbitrary trajectories. In this paper, we delve deep into the mechanism of space warping to handle unbounded scenes. Based on our analysis, we further propose a novel space-warping method called perspective warping, which allows us to handle arbitrary trajectories in the grid-based NeRF framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F^2-NeRF is able to use the same perspective warping to render high-quality images on two standard datasets and a new free trajectory dataset collected by us.",

        "content1": "The objective of voice conversion system is to formulate the mapping function which can transform the source speaker characteristics to that of the target speaker. In this paper, we propose the General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) based model for voice conversion. It is a single pass learning network that makes the training procedure fast and comparatively less time consuming. The proposed system uses the shape of the vocal tract, the shape of the glottal pulse (excitation signal) and long term prosodic features to carry out the voice conversion task. In this paper, the shape of the vocal tract and the shape of source excitation of a particular speaker are represented using Line Spectral Frequencies (LSFs) and Linear Prediction (LP) residual respectively. GRNN is used to obtain the mapping function between the source and target speakers. The direct transformation of the time domain residual using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) causes phase change and generates artifacts in consecutive frames. In order to alleviate it, wavelet packet decomposed coefficients are used to characterize the excitation of the speech signal. The long term prosodic parameters namely, pitch contour (intonation) and the energy profile of the test signal are also modified in relation to that of the target (desired) speaker using the baseline method. The relative performances of the proposed model are compared to voice conversion system based on the state of the art RBF and GMM models using objective and subjective evaluation measures. The evaluation measures show that the proposed GRNN based voice conversion system performs slightly better than the state of the art models.",

Due to the business process nature of these conversations, end-to-end machine learning systems are generally not a viable option, as the generated dialogue agents must be deployable and verifiable on behalf of the businesses authoring them.\n  In this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the creation of goal-oriented complex dialogue systems that dramatically eliminates the need for a designer to manually specify a dialogue tree, which nearly all current systems have to resort to when the interaction pattern falls outside standard patterns such as slot filling. We propose a declarative representation of the dialogue agent to be processed by state-of-the-art planning technology. Our proposed approach covers all aspects of the process; from model solicitation to the execution of the generated plans/dialogue agents. Along the way, we introduce novel planning encodings for declarative dialogue synthesis, a variety of interfaces for working with the specification as a dialogue architect, and a robust executor for generalized contingent plans.

With further fine-tuning on a small amount of target domain data, the agents continue to interact with the aim of improving their behaviors using reinforcement learning with structured reward functions. In experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, two practical transfer learning problems are investigated: 1) domain adaptation and 2) single-to-multiple domain transfer.

NeRFs learn a scene's color and density fields by minimizing the photometric discrepancy between training views and differentiable renderings of the scene. Once trained from a sufficient set of views, NeRFs can generate novel views from arbitrary camera positions. However, the scene geometry and color fields are severely under-constrained, which can lead to artifacts, especially when trained with few input views. To alleviate this problem we learn a prior over scene geometry and color, using a denoising diffusion model (DDM). Our DDM is trained on RGBD patches of the synthetic Hypersim dataset and can be used to predict the gradient of the logarithm of a joint probability distribution of color and depth patches. We show that, these gradients of logarithms of RGBD patch priors serve to regularize geometry and color of a scene. During NeRF training, random RGBD patches are rendered and the estimated gradient of the log-likelihood is backpropagated to the color and density fields. Evaluations on LLFF, the most relevant dataset, show that our learned prior achieves improved quality in the reconstructed geometry and improved generalization to novel views. Evaluations on DTU show improved reconstruction quality among NeRF methods.",

By aligning the hidden structures of the two different feature spaces with a two-stage training process, FragmentVC is able to extract fine-grained voice fragments from the target speaker utterance(s) and fuse them into the desired utterance, all based on the attention mechanism of Transformer as verified with analysis on attention maps, and is accomplished end-to-end.

        "content2": "In Voice Conversion (VC), the speech of a source speaker is modified to resemble that of a particular target speaker. Currently, standard VC approaches use Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based transformations that do not generate high-quality converted speech due to “over-smoothing” resulting from weak links between individual source and target frame parameters. Dynamic Frequency Warping (DFW) offers an appealing alternative to GMM-based methods, as more spectral details are maintained in transformation; however, the speaker timbre is less successfully converted because spectral power is not adjusted explicitly. Previous work combines separate GMM- and DFW-transformed spectral envelopes for each frame. This paper proposes a more effective DFW-based approach that (1) does not rely on the baseline GMM methods, and (2) functions on the acoustic class level. To adjust spectral power, an amplitude scaling function is used that compares the average target and warped source log spectra for each acoustic class. The proposed DFW with Amplitude scaling (DFWA) outperforms standard GMM and hybrid GMM-DFW methods for VC in terms of both speech quality and timbre conversion, as is confirmed in extensive objective and subjective testing. Furthermore, by not requiring time-alignment of source and target speech, DFWA is able to perform equally well using parallel or nonparallel corpora, as is demonstrated explicitly.",

Moreover, judges tend to evaluate a small number of dialogues, meaning that minor differences in evaluation configuration may lead to dissimilar results.

Furthermore, we introduce calculable approximations of human judgment based on conversational coherence by adopting state-of-the-art entailment techniques.

Instead of calculating a single radiance field, we propose a multispace neural radiance field (MS-NeRF) that represents the scene using a group of feature fields in parallel sub-spaces, which leads to a better understanding of the neural network toward the existence of reflective and refractive objects. Our multi-space scheme works as an enhancement to existing NeRF methods, with only small computational overheads needed for training and inferring the extra-space outputs. We demonstrate the superiority and compatibility of our approach using three representative NeRF-based models, i.e., NeRF, Mip-NeRF, and Mip-NeRF 360. Comparisons are performed on a novelly constructed dataset consisting of 25 synthetic scenes and 7 real captured scenes with complex reflection and refraction, all having 360-degree viewpoints.

However, NeRF's computational requirements are prohibitive for real-time applications: rendering views from a trained NeRF requires querying a multilayer perceptron (MLP) hundreds of times per ray. We present a method to train a NeRF, then precompute and store (i.e. \"\"bake\"\") it as a novel representation called a Sparse Neural Radiance Grid (SNeRG) that enables real-time rendering on commodity hardware. To achieve this, we introduce 1) a reformulation of NeRF's architecture, and 2) a sparse voxel grid representation with learned feature vectors. The resulting scene representation retains NeRF's ability to render fine geometric details and view-dependent appearance, is compact (averaging less than 90 MB per scene), and can be rendered in real-time (higher than 30 frames per second on a laptop GPU).

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieves impressive ren-dering performance by learning volumetric 3D representation from several images of different views. However, it is difficult to reconstruct a sharp NeRF from blurry input as often occurred in the wild. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Event-Enhanced NeRF (E2NeRF) by utilizing the combination data of a bio-inspired event camera and a standard RGB camera. To effectively introduce event stream into the learning process of neural volumetric representation, we propose a blur rendering loss and an event rendering loss, which guide the network via modelling real blur process and event generation process, respectively. Moreover, a camera pose estimation framework for real-world data is built with the guidance of event stream to generalize the method to practical applications. In contrast to previous image-based or event-based NeRF, our framework effectively utilizes the internal relationship between events and images. As a result, E2NeRF not only achieves image deblurring but also achieves high-quality novel view image generation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate that E2NeRF can effectively learn a sharp NeRF from blurry images, especially in complex and low-light scenes.

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) regresses a neural parameterized scene by differentially rendering multi-view images with ground-truth supervision. However, when interpolating novel views, NeRF often yields inconsistent and visually non-smooth geometric results, which we consider as a generalization gap between seen and unseen views. Recent advances in convolutional neural networks have demonstrated the promise of advanced robust data augmentations, either random or learned, in enhancing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization. Inspired by that, we propose Augmented NeRF (Aug-NeRF), which for the first time brings the power of robust data augmentations into regularizing the NeRF training. Particularly, our proposal learns to seamlessly blend worst-case perturbations into three distinct levels of the NeRF pipeline with physical grounds, including (1) the input coordinates, to simulate imprecise camera parameters at image capture; (2) intermediate features, to smoothen the intrinsic feature manifold; and (3) pre-rendering output, to account for the potential degradation factors in the multi-view image supervision. Extensive results demonstrate that Aug-NeRF effectively boosts NeRF performance in both novel view synthesis (up to 1.5 dB PSNR gain) and underlying geometry reconstruction. Furthermore, thanks to the implicit smooth prior injected by the triple-level augmentations, Aug-NeRF can even recover scenes from heavily corrupted images, a highly challenging setting untackled before.

The input source signal is decomposed into the source exemplars, noise exemplars obtained from the input signal, and their weights (activities).

        "content1": "Asynchronously operating event cameras find many applications due to their high dynamic range, vanishingly low motion blur, low latency and low data bandwidth. The field saw remarkable progress during the last few years, and existing event-based 3D reconstruction approaches recover sparse point clouds of the scene. However, such sparsity is a limiting factor in many cases, especially in computer vision and graphics, that has not been addressed satisfactorily so far. Accordingly, this paper proposes the first approach for 3D-consistent, dense and photorealistic novel view synthesis using just a single colour event stream as input. At its core is a neural radiance field trained entirely in a self-supervised manner from events while preserving the original resolution of the colour event channels. Next, our ray sampling strategy is tailored to events and allows for data-efficient training. At test, our method produces results in the RGB space at unprecedented quality. We evaluate our method qualitatively and numerically on several challenging synthetic and real scenes and show that it produces significantly denser and more visually appealing renderings than the existing methods. We also demonstrate robustness in challenging scenarios with fast motion and under low lighting conditions. We release the newly recorded dataset and our source code to facilitate the research field, see https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/EventNeRF.",

To do so, the first step is to understand the intricate organization of strategic disclosures and appeals employed in human persuasion conversations. We designed an online persuasion task where one participant was asked to persuade the other to donate to a specific charity. We collected a large dataset with 1,017 dialogues and annotated emerging persuasion strategies from a subset. Based on the annotation, we built a baseline classifier with context information and sentence-level features to predict the 10 persuasion strategies used in the corpus. Furthermore, to develop an understanding of personalized persuasion processes, we analyzed the relationships between individuals' demographic and psychological backgrounds including personality, morality, value systems, and their willingness for donation. Then, we analyzed which types of persuasion strategies led to a greater amount of donation depending on the individuals' personal backgrounds. This work lays the ground for developing a personalized persuasive dialogue system.",
        "content2": "The ability to compute an accurate reward function is essential for optimising a dialogue policy via reinforcement learning. In real-world applications, using explicit user feedback as the reward signal is often unreliable and costly to collect. This problem can be mitigated if the user's intent is known in advance or data is available to pre-train a task success predictor off-line. In practice neither of these apply for most real world applications. Here we propose an on-line learning framework whereby the dialogue policy is jointly trained alongside the reward model via active learning with a Gaussian process model. This Gaussian process operates on a continuous space dialogue representation generated in an unsupervised fashion using a recurrent neural network encoder-decoder. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to significantly reduce data annotation costs and mitigate noisy user feedback in dialogue policy learning.",

        "content1": "Estimating neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from “ideal” images has been extensively studied in the computer vision community. Most approaches assume optimal illumination and slow camera motion. These assumptions are often violated in robotic applications, where images may contain motion blur, and the scene may not have suitable illumination. This can cause significant problems for downstream tasks such as navigation, inspection, or visualization of the scene. To alleviate these problems, we present E-NeRF, the first method which estimates a volumetric scene representation in the form of a NeRF from a fast-moving event camera. Our method can recover NeRFs during very fast motion and in high-dynamic-range conditions where frame-based approaches fail. We show that rendering high-quality frames is possible by only providing an event stream as input. Furthermore, by combining events and frames, we can estimate NeRFs of higher quality than state-of-the-art approaches under severe motion blur. We also show that combining events and frames can overcome failure cases of NeRF estimation in scenarios where only a few input views are available without requiring additional regularization.",

First, we show that, on summary state and action spaces, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) outperforms Gaussian Processes methods. Summary state and action spaces lead to good performance but require pre-engineering effort, RL knowledge, and domain expertise. In order to remove the need to define such summary spaces, we show that deep RL can also be trained efficiently on the original state and action spaces. Dialogue systems based on partially observable Markov decision processes are known to require many dialogues to train, which makes them unappealing for practical deployment. We show that a deep RL method based on an actor-critic architecture can exploit a small amount of data very efficiently. Indeed, with only a few hundred dialogues collected with a handcrafted policy, the actor-critic deep learner is considerably bootstrapped from a combination of supervised and batch RL. In addition, convergence to an optimal policy is significantly sped up compared to other deep RL methods initialized on the data with batch RL.

At training stage, a SCENT model is estimated by aligning the feature sequences of source and target speakers implicitly using attention mechanism. At the conversion stage, acoustic features and durations of source utterances are converted simultaneously using the unified acoustic model. Mel-scale spectrograms are adopted as acoustic features, which contain both excitation and vocal tract descriptions of speech signals. The bottleneck features extracted from source speech using an automatic speech recognition model are appended as an auxiliary input. A WaveNet vocoder conditioned on Mel-spectrograms is built to reconstruct waveforms from the outputs of the SCENT model. It is worth noting that our proposed method can achieve appropriate duration conversion, which is difficult in conventional methods. Experimental results show that our proposed method obtained better objective and subjective performance than the baseline methods using Gaussian mixture models and deep neural networks as acoustic models.

As one crucial application of AI, dialogue systems have been extensively applied in our society. They are usually built with real human conversational data; thus they could inherit some fairness issues which are held in the real world. However, the fairness of dialogue systems has not been well investigated. In this paper, we perform a pioneering study about the fairness issues in dialogue systems. In particular, we construct a benchmark dataset and propose quantitative measures to understand fairness in dialogue models. Our studies demonstrate that popular dialogue models show significant prejudice towards different genders and races. Besides, to mitigate the bias in dialogue systems, we propose two simple but effective debiasing methods. Experiments show that our methods can reduce the bias in dialogue systems significantly.

        "content1": "Non-parallel multi-domain voice conversion (VC) is a technique for learning mappings among multiple domains without relying on parallel data. This is important but challenging owing to the requirement of learning multiple mappings and the non-availability of explicit supervision. Recently, StarGAN-VC has garnered attention owing to its ability to solve this problem only using a single generator. However, there is still a gap between real and converted speech. To bridge this gap, we rethink conditional methods of StarGAN-VC, which are key components for achieving non-parallel multi-domain VC in a single model, and propose an improved variant called StarGAN-VC2. Particularly, we rethink conditional methods in two aspects: training objectives and network architectures. For the former, we propose a source-and-target conditional adversarial loss that allows all source domain data to be convertible to the target domain data. For the latter, we introduce a modulation-based conditional method that can transform the modulation of the acoustic feature in a domain-specific manner. We evaluated our methods on non-parallel multi-speaker VC. An objective evaluation demonstrates that our proposed methods improve speech quality in terms of both global and local structure measures.

First, we show that, on summary state and action spaces, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) outperforms Gaussian Processes methods. Summary state and action spaces lead to good performance but require pre-engineering effort, RL knowledge, and domain expertise. In order to remove the need to define such summary spaces, we show that deep RL can also be trained efficiently on the original state and action spaces. Dialogue systems based on partially observable Markov decision processes are known to require many dialogues to train, which makes them unappealing for practical deployment. We show that a deep RL method based on an actor-critic architecture can exploit a small amount of data very efficiently. Indeed, with only a few hundred dialogues collected with a handcrafted policy, the actor-critic deep learner is considerably bootstrapped from a combination of supervised and batch RL. In addition, convergence to an optimal policy is significantly sped up compared to other deep RL methods initialized on the data with batch RL.

Automatic metrics such as BLEU correlate weakly with human annotations, resulting in a significant bias across different models and datasets.

Moreover, judges tend to evaluate a small number of dialogues, meaning that minor differences in evaluation configuration may lead to dissimilar results. In this paper, we present interpretable metrics for evaluating topic coherence by making use of distributed sentence representations. Furthermore, we introduce calculable approximations of human judgment based on conversational coherence by adopting state-of-the-art entailment techniques.

MinTL is a simple yet effective transfer learning framework, which allows us to plug-and-play pre-trained seq2seq models, and jointly learn dialogue state tracking and dialogue response generation. Unlike previous approaches, which use a copy mechanism to \"carryover\" the old dialogue states to the new one, we introduce Levenshtein belief spans (Lev), that allows efficient dialogue state tracking with a minimal generation length. We instantiate our learning framework with two pre-trained backbones: T5 and BART, and evaluate them on MultiWOZ. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: 1) our systems establish new state-of-the-art results on end-to-end response generation, 2) MinTL-based systems are more robust than baseline methods in the low resource setting, and they achieve competitive results with only 20\\% training data, and 3) Lev greatly improves the inference efficiency.",

        "content1": "In this paper, we present a novel technique for a non-parallel voice conversion (VC) with the use of cyclic variational autoencoder (CycleVAE)-based spectral modeling. In a variational autoencoder(VAE) framework, a latent space, usually with a Gaussian prior, is used to encode a set of input features. In a VAE-based VC, the encoded latent features are fed into a decoder, along with speaker-coding features, to generate estimated spectra with either the original speaker identity (reconstructed) or another speaker identity (converted). Due to the non-parallel modeling condition, the converted spectra can not be directly optimized, which heavily degrades the performance of a VAE-based VC. In this work, to overcome this problem, we propose to use CycleVAE-based spectral model that indirectly optimizes the conversion flow by recycling the converted features back into the system to obtain corresponding cyclic reconstructed spectra that can be directly optimized. The cyclic flow can be continued by using the cyclic reconstructed features as input for the next cycle. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CycleVAE-based VC, which yields higher accuracy of converted spectra, generates latent features with higher correlation degree, and significantly improves the quality and conversion accuracy of the converted speech.",

Given a sequence of posed RGB images and lidar sweeps acquired by cameras and scanners moving through an outdoor scene, we produce a model from which 3D surfaces can be extracted and novel RGB images can be synthesized. Our approach extends Neural Radiance Fields, which has been demonstrated to synthesize realistic novel images for small scenes in controlled settings, with new methods for leveraging asynchronously captured lidar data, for addressing exposure variation between captured images, and for leveraging predicted image segmentations to supervise densities on rays pointing at the sky. Each of these three extensions provides significant performance improvements in experiments on Street View data. Our system produces state-of-the-art 3D surface reconstructions and synthesizes higher quality novel views in comparison to both traditional methods (e.g. COLMAP) and recent neural representations (e.g. Mip-NeRF).",

It is applied to a residual-excited LPC text-to-speech diphone synthesizer. Spectral parameters are mapped using a locally linear transformation based on Gaussian mixture models whose parameters are trained by joint density estimation. The LPC residuals are adjusted to match the target speakers average pitch. To study effects of the amount of training on performance, data sets of varying sizes are created by automatically selecting subsets of all available diphones by a vector quantization method. In an objective evaluation, the proposed method is found to perform more reliably for small training sets than a previous approach. In perceptual tests, it was shown that nearly optimal spectral conversion performance was achieved, even with a small amount of training data. However, speech quality improved with increases in the training set size.",

        "content1": "We present High Dynamic Range Neural Radiance Fields (HDR-NeRF) to recover an HDR radiance field from a set of low dynamic range (LDR) views with different exposures. Using the HDR-NeRF, we are able to generate both novel HDR views and novel LDR views under different exposures. The key to our method is to model the physical imaging process, which dictates that the radiance of a scene point transforms to a pixel value in the LDR image with two implicit functions: a radiance field and a tone mapper. The radiance field encodes the scene radiance (values vary from 0 to +infty), which outputs the density and radiance of a ray by giving corresponding ray origin and ray direction. The tone mapper models the mapping process that a ray hitting on the camera sensor becomes a pixel value. The color of the ray is predicted by feeding the radiance and the corresponding exposure time into the tone mapper. We use the classic volume rendering technique to project the output radiance, colors, and densities into HDR and LDR images, while only the input LDR images are used as the supervision. We collect a new forward-facing HDR dataset to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world scenes validate that our method can not only accurately control the exposures of synthesized views but also render views with a high dynamic range.",

In this article we focus on two problems of speech produced with an EL (EL speech). One problem is that EL speech is extremely unnatural and the other is that sound source signals with high energy are generated by an EL, and therefore, the signals often annoy surrounding people. To address these two problems, in this article we propose three speaking-aid systems that enhance three different types of EL speech signals: EL speech, EL speech using an air-pressure sensor (EL-air speech), and silent EL speech. The air-pressure sensor enables a laryngectomee to manipulate the F0 contours of EL speech using exhaled air that flows from the tracheostoma. Silent EL speech is produced with a new sound source unit that generates signals with extremely low energy. Our speaking-aid systems address the poor quality of EL speech using voice conversion (VC), which transforms acoustic features so that it appears as if the speech is uttered by another person. Our systems estimate spectral parameters, F0, and aperiodic components independently. The result of experimental evaluations demonstrates that the use of an air-pressure sensor dramatically improves F0 estimation accuracy.

However, a successful reconstruction from RGB images requires a large number of input views taken under static conditions - typically up to a few hundred images for room-size scenes. Our method aims to synthesize novel views of whole rooms from an order of magnitude fewer images. To this end, we leverage dense depth priors in order to constrain the NeRF optimization. First, we take advantage of the sparse depth data that is freely available from the structure from motion (SfM) preprocessing step used to estimate camera poses. Second, we use depth completion to convert these sparse points into dense depth maps and uncertainty estimates, which are used to guide NeRF optimization. Our method enables data-efficient novel view synthesis on challenging indoor scenes, using as few as 18 images for an entire scene.",

Nonetheless, without sufficient data, seq2seq VC models can suffer from unstable training and mispronunciation problems in the converted speech, thus far from practical. To tackle these shortcomings, we propose to transfer knowledge from other speech processing tasks where large-scale corpora are easily available, typically text-to-speech (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR). We argue that VC models initialized with such pretrained ASR or TTS model parameters can generate effective hidden representations for high-fidelity, highly intelligible converted speech. In this work, we examine our proposed method in a parallel, one-to-one setting.

Recently, Gaussian processes have been shown to substantially speed up the optimisation, making it possible to learn directly from interaction with human users. However, early studies have been limited to very low dimensional spaces and the learning has exhibited convergence problems. Here we investigate learning from human interaction using the Bayesian Update of Dialogue State system. This dynamic Bayesian network based system has an optimisation space covering more than one hundred features, allowing a wide range of behaviours to be learned. Using an improved policy model and a more robust reward function, we show that stable learning can be achieved that significantly outperforms a simulator trained policy.",

        "content1": "The rendering procedure used by neural radiance fields (NeRF) samples a scene with a single ray per pixel and may therefore produce renderings that are excessively blurred or aliased when training or testing images observe scene content at different resolutions. The straightforward solution of supersampling by rendering with multiple rays per pixel is impractical for NeRF, because rendering each ray requires querying a multilayer perceptron hundreds of times. Our solution, which we call \"mip-NeRF\" (a la \"mipmap\"), extends NeRF to represent the scene at a continuously-valued scale. By efficiently rendering anti-aliased conical frustums instead of rays, mip-NeRF reduces objectionable aliasing artifacts and significantly improves NeRF's ability to represent fine details, while also being 7% faster than NeRF and half the size. Compared to NeRF, mip-NeRF reduces average error rates by 17% on the dataset presented with NeRF and by 60% on a challenging multiscale variant of that dataset that we present. Mip-NeRF is also able to match the accuracy of a brute-force supersampled NeRF on our multiscale dataset while being 22x faster.",
        "content2": "Recent progress on multi-view 3D object reconstruction has featured neural implicit surfaces via learning high-fidelity radiance fields. However, most approaches hinge on the visual hull derived from cost-expensive silhouette masks to obtain object surfaces. In this paper, we propose a novel Object-aware Radiance Fields (ORF) to automatically learn an object-aware geometry reconstruction. The geometric correspondences between multi-view 2D object regions and 3D implicit/explicit object surfaces are additionally exploited to boost the learning of object surfaces. Technically, a critical transparency discriminator is designed to distinguish the object-intersected and object-bypassed rays based on the estimated 2D object regions, leading to 3D implicit object surfaces. Such implicit surfaces can be directly converted into explicit object surfaces (e.g., meshes) via marching cubes. Then, we build the geometric correspondence between 2D planes and 3D meshes by rasterization, and project the estimated object regions into 3D explicit object surfaces by aggregating the object information across multiple views. The aggregated object information in 3D explicit object surfaces is further reprojected back to 2D planes, aiming to update 2D object regions and enforce them to be multi-view consistent. Extensive experiments on DTU and BlendedMVS verify the capability of ORF to produce comparable surfaces against the state-of-the-art models that demand silhouette masks.",

Despite their success, existing methods often formulate this task as a cascaded generation problem which can lead to error accumulation across different sub-tasks and greater data annotation overhead. In this study, we present PPTOD, a unified plug-and-play model for task-oriented dialogue. In addition, we introduce a new dialogue multi-task pre-training strategy that allows the model to learn the primary TOD task completion skills from heterogeneous dialog corpora. We extensively test our model on three benchmark TOD tasks, including end-to-end dialogue modelling, dialogue state tracking, and intent classification. Experimental results show that PPTOD achieves new state of the art on all evaluated tasks in both high-resource and low-resource scenarios. Furthermore, comparisons against previous SOTA methods show that the responses generated by PPTOD are more factually correct and semantically coherent as judged by human annotators.",

While it has been demonstrated that human judgments can suffer from the inconsistency of ratings, extant research has also found that the design of the evaluation task affects the consistency and quality of human judgments. We conduct a between-subjects study to understand the impact of four experiment conditions on human ratings of dialogue system output. In addition to discrete and continuous scale ratings, we also experiment with a novel application of Best-Worst scaling to dialogue evaluation. Through our systematic study with 40 crowdsourced workers in each task, we find that using continuous scales achieves more consistent ratings than Likert scale or ranking-based experiment design. Additionally, we find that factors such as time taken to complete the task and no prior experience of participating in similar studies of rating dialogue system output positively impact consistency and agreement amongst raters",

However, such model suffers from the limitation that it can only convert the voice to the speakers in the training data, which narrows down the applicable scenario of VC. In this paper, we proposed a novel one-shot VC approach which is able to perform VC by only an example utterance from source and target speaker respectively, and the source and target speaker do not even need to be seen during training. This is achieved by disentangling speaker and content representations with instance normalization (IN). Objective and subjective evaluation shows that our model is able to generate the voice similar to target speaker. In addition to the performance measurement, we also demonstrate that this model is able to learn meaningful speaker representations without any supervision.",

Unlike previous approaches that either lack sufficient geometry deformations and texture details or require meshes to guide the stylization, our method can shift a 3D scene to the target style characterized by desired geometry and appearance variations without any mesh guidance. This is achieved by introducing a novel global-local contrastive learning strategy, combined with the directional constraint to simultaneously control both the trajectory and the strength of the target style. Moreover, we adopt a weight regularization method to effectively suppress cloudy artifacts and geometry noises which arise easily when the density field is transformed during geometry stylization. Through extensive experiments on various styles, we demonstrate that our method is effective and robust regarding both single-view stylization quality and cross-view consistency.

In this paper, we explore enabling user editing of a category-level NeRF trained on a shape category. Specifically, we propose a method for propagating coarse 2D user scribbles to the 3D space, to modify the color or shape of a local region. First, we propose a conditional radiance field that incorporates new modular network components, including a branch that is shared across object instances in the category. Observing multiple instances of the same category, our model learns underlying part semantics without any supervision, thereby allowing the propagation of coarse 2D user scribbles to the entire 3D region (e.g., chair seat) in a consistent fashion. Next, we investigate for the editing tasks which components of our network require updating. We propose a hybrid network update strategy that targets the later network components, which balances efficiency and accuracy. During user interaction, we formulate an optimization problem that both satisfies the user's constraints and preserves the original object structure. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of editing tasks over three shape datasets and show that it outperforms prior neural editing approaches. Finally, we edit the appearance and shape of a real photograph and show that the edit propagates to extrapolated novel views.",

The response of knowledge grounded conversation might contain multiple answer entities or no entity at all. Although existing generative question answering (QA) systems can be applied to knowledge grounded conversation, they either have at most one entity in a response or cannot deal with out-of-vocabulary entities. We propose a fully data-driven generative dialogue system GenDS that is capable of generating responses based on input message and related knowledge base (KB). To generate arbitrary number of answer entities even when these entities never appear in the training set, we design a dynamic knowledge enquirer which selects different answer entities at different positions in a single response, according to different local context. It does not rely on the representations of entities, enabling our model deal with out-of-vocabulary entities. We collect a human-human conversation data (ConversMusic) with knowledge annotations. The proposed method is evaluated on CoversMusic and a public question answering dataset. Our proposed GenDS system outperforms baseline methods significantly in terms of the BLEU, entity accuracy, entity recall and human evaluation. Moreover,the experiments also demonstrate that GenDS works better even on small datasets.",

While it has been demonstrated that human judgments can suffer from the inconsistency of ratings, extant research has also found that the design of the evaluation task affects the consistency and quality of human judgments. We conduct a between-subjects study to understand the impact of four experiment conditions on human ratings of dialogue system output. In addition to discrete and continuous scale ratings, we also experiment with a novel application of Best-Worst scaling to dialogue evaluation. Through our systematic study with 40 crowdsourced workers in each task, we find that using continuous scales achieves more consistent ratings than Likert scale or ranking-based experiment design. Additionally, we find that factors such as time taken to complete the task and no prior experience of participating in similar studies of rating dialogue system output positively impact consistency and agreement amongst raters",

However, current NeRF-based methods still suffer from the existence of reflective objects, often resulting in blurry or distorted rendering. Instead of calculating a single radiance field, we propose a multispace neural radiance field (MS-NeRF) that represents the scene using a group of feature fields in parallel sub-spaces, which leads to a better understanding of the neural network toward the existence of reflective and refractive objects. Our multi-space scheme works as an enhancement to existing NeRF methods, with only small computational overheads needed for training and inferring the extra-space outputs. We demonstrate the superiority and compatibility of our approach using three representative NeRF-based models, i.e., NeRF, Mip-NeRF, and Mip-NeRF 360. Comparisons are performed on a novelly constructed dataset consisting of 25 synthetic scenes and 7 real captured scenes with complex reflection and refraction, all having 360-degree viewpoints.

While achieving compelling results, most approaches operate in the two-dimensional image domain, ignoring the three-dimensional nature of our world. Several recent works therefore propose generative models which are 3D-aware, i.e., scenes are modeled in 3D and then rendered differentiably to the image plane. While this leads to impressive 3D consistency, the camera needs to be modelled as well and we show in this work that these methods are sensitive to the choice of prior camera distributions. Current approaches assume fixed intrinsics and predefined priors over camera pose ranges, and parameter tuning is typically required for real-world data. If the data distribution is not matched, results degrade significantly. Our key hypothesis is that learning a camera generator jointly with the image generator leads to a more principled approach to 3D-aware image synthesis. Further, we propose to decompose the scene into a background and foreground model, leading to more efficient and disentangled scene representations. While training from raw, unposed image collections, we learn a 3D- and camera-aware generative model which faithfully recovers not only the image but also the camera data distribution. At test time, our model generates images with explicit control over the camera as well as the shape and appearance of the scene.",

        "content1": "In a spoken dialog system, determining which action a machine should take in a given situation is a difficult problem because automatic speech recognition is unreliable and hence the state of the conversation can never be known with certainty. Much of the research in spoken dialog systems centres on mitigating this uncertainty and recent work has focussed on three largely disparate techniques: parallel dialog state hypotheses, local use of confidence scores, and automated planning. While in isolation each of these approaches can improve action selection, taken together they currently lack a unified statistical framework that admits global optimization. In this paper we cast a spoken dialog system as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We show how this formulation unifies and extends existing techniques to form a single principled framework. A number of illustrations are used to show qualitatively the potential benefits of POMDPs compared to existing techniques, and empirical results from dialog simulations are presented which demonstrate significant quantitative gains. Finally, some of the key challenges to advancing this method – in particular scalability – are briefly outlined.",

In this work we study various model architectures and different ways to represent and aggregate the source information in an end-to-end neural dialogue system framework. A method called snapshot learning is also proposed to facilitate learning from supervised sequential signals by applying a companion cross-entropy objective function to the conditioning vector. The experimental and analytical results demonstrate firstly that competition occurs between the conditioning vector and the LM, and the differing architectures provide different trade-offs between the two. Secondly, the discriminative power and transparency of the conditioning vector is key to providing both model interpretability and better performance. Thirdly, snapshot learning leads to consistent performance improvements independent of which architecture is used.",

We conduct listening tests based on speaker discrimination of same/difference pairs to measure the accuracy by which the converted voices match the desired target voices. To establish the level of human performance as a baseline, we first measure the ability of listeners to discriminate between original speech utterances under three conditions: normal, fundamental frequency and duration normalized, and LPC coded. Additionally, the spectral parameter conversion function is tested in isolation by listening to source, target, and converted speakers as LPC coded speech. The results show that the speaker identity of speech whose LPC spectrum has been converted can be recognized as the target speaker with the same level of performance as discriminating between LPC coded speech. However, the level of discrimination of converted utterances produced by the full VC system is significantly below that of speaker discrimination of natural speech.",

The straightforward solution of supersampling by rendering with multiple rays per pixel is impractical for NeRF, because rendering each ray requires querying a multilayer perceptron hundreds of times. Our solution, which we call \"mip-NeRF\" (a la \"mipmap\"), extends NeRF to represent the scene at a continuously-valued scale. By efficiently rendering anti-aliased conical frustums instead of rays, mip-NeRF reduces objectionable aliasing artifacts and significantly improves NeRF's ability to represent fine details, while also being 7% faster than NeRF and half the size. Compared to NeRF, mip-NeRF reduces average error rates by 17% on the dataset presented with NeRF and by 60% on a challenging multiscale variant of that dataset that we present. Mip-NeRF is also able to match the accuracy of a brute-force supersampled NeRF on our multiscale dataset while being 22x faster.",
        "content2": "Training a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) without pre-computed camera poses is challenging. Recent advances in this direction demonstrate the possibility of jointly optimising a NeRF and camera poses in forward-facing scenes. However, these methods still face difficulties during dramatic camera movement. We tackle this challenging problem by incorporating undistorted monocular depth priors. These priors are generated by correcting scale and shift parameters during training, with which we are then able to constrain the relative poses between consecutive frames. This constraint is achieved using our proposed novel loss functions. Experiments on real-world indoor and outdoor scenes show that our method can handle challenging camera trajectories and outperforms existing methods in terms of novel view rendering quality and pose estimation accuracy.

However, NeRF requires querying a deep Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) millions of times, leading to slow rendering times, even on modern GPUs. In this paper, we demonstrate that real-time rendering is possible by utilizing thousands of tiny MLPs instead of one single large MLP. In our setting, each individual MLP only needs to represent parts of the scene, thus smaller and faster-to-evaluate MLPs can be used. By combining this divide-and-conquer strategy with further optimizations, rendering is accelerated by three orders of magnitude compared to the original NeRF model without incurring high storage costs. Further, using teacher-student distillation for training, we show that this speed-up can be achieved without sacrificing visual quality.",

NeRFs have been shown to be remarkably effective for the task of view synthesis — synthesizing photorealistic novel views of real-world scenes or objects. In this work, we investigate whether we can apply analysis-by-synthesis via NeRF for mesh-free, RGB-only 6DoF pose estimation – given an image, find the translation and rotation of a camera relative to a 3D object or scene. Our method assumes that no object mesh models are available during either training or test time. Starting from an initial pose estimate, we use gradient descent to minimize the residual between pixels rendered from a NeRF and pixels in an observed image. In our experiments, we first study 1) how to sample rays during pose refinement for iNeRF to collect informative gradients and 2) how different batch sizes of rays affect iNeRF on a synthetic dataset. We then show that for complex real-world scenes from the LLFF dataset [21], iNeRF can improve NeRF by estimating the camera poses of novel images and using these images as additional training data for NeRF. Finally, we show iNeRF can perform categorylevel object pose estimation, including object instances not seen during training, with RGB images by inverting a NeRF model inferred from a single view.",

The proposed models are tested on large-scale listening test results of the Voice Conversion Challenge (VCC) 2018. Experimental results show that the predicted scores of the proposed MOSNet are highly correlated with human MOS ratings at the system level while being fairly correlated with human MOS ratings at the utterance level. Meanwhile, we have modified MOSNet to predict the similarity scores, and the preliminary results show that the predicted scores are also fairly correlated with human ratings. These results confirm that the proposed models could be used as a computational evaluator to measure the MOS of VC systems to reduce the need for expensive human rating.",

The response of knowledge grounded conversation might contain multiple answer entities or no entity at all.

We propose a fully data-driven generative dialogue system GenDS that is capable of generating responses based on input message and related knowledge base (KB). To generate arbitrary number of answer entities even when these entities never appear in the training set, we design a dynamic knowledge enquirer which selects different answer entities at different positions in a single response, according to different local context. It does not rely on the representations of entities, enabling our model deal with out-of-vocabulary entities. We collect a human-human conversation data (ConversMusic) with knowledge annotations.

In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the robustness of NeRF-based novel view synthesis algorithms in the presence of different types of corruptions.\n  We find that NeRF-based models are significantly degraded in the presence of corruption, and are more sensitive to a different set of corruptions than image recognition models. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of the feature encoder in generalizable methods, which synthesize images using neural features extracted via convolutional neural networks or transformers, and find that it only contributes marginally to robustness. Finally, we reveal that standard data augmentation techniques, which can significantly improve the robustness of recognition models, do not help the robustness of NeRF-based models.

In this paper, we propose a technique based on spatial decomposition capable of mitigating this issue. Our key observation is that there are diminishing returns in employing larger (deeper and/or wider) networks. Hence, we propose to spatially decompose a scene and dedicate smaller networks for each decomposed part. When working together, these networks can render the whole scene. This allows us near-constant inference time regardless of the number of decomposed parts. Moreover, we show that a Voronoi spatial decomposition is preferable for this purpose, as it is provably compatible with the Painter's Algorithm for efficient and GPU-friendly rendering. Our experiments show that for real-world scenes, our method provides up to 3x more efficient inference than NeRF (with the same rendering quality), or an improvement of up to 1.0 dB in PSNR (for the same inference cost).",

However, NeRF's estimated volume density does not admit accurate surface reconstruction. Our key insight is that implicit surface models and radiance fields can be formulated in a unified way, enabling both surface and volume rendering using the same model. This unified perspective enables novel, more efficient sampling procedures and the ability to reconstruct accurate surfaces without input masks. We compare our method on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and a synthetic indoor dataset.

Our idea is to explicitly exploit the unequal contribution of spatial regions to guide talking portrait modeling. Specifically, to improve the accuracy of dynamic head reconstruction, a compact and expressive NeRF-based Tri-Plane Hash Representation is introduced by pruning empty spatial regions with three planar hash encoders. For speech audio, we propose a Region Attention Module to generate region-aware condition feature via an attention mechanism. Different from existing methods that utilize an MLP-based encoder to learn the cross-modal relation implicitly, the attention mechanism builds an explicit connection between audio features and spatial regions to capture the priors of local motions. Moreover, a direct and fast Adaptive Pose Encoding is introduced to optimize the head-torso separation problem by mapping the complex transformation of the head pose into spatial coordinates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method renders better high-fidelity and audio-lips synchronized talking portrait videos, with realistic details and high efficiency compared to previous methods.",

Unlike previous approaches that either lack sufficient geometry deformations and texture details or require meshes to guide the stylization, our method can shift a 3D scene to the target style characterized by desired geometry and appearance variations without any mesh guidance.

Moreover, we adopt a weight regularization method to effectively suppress cloudy artifacts and geometry noises which arise easily when the density field is transformed during geometry stylization. Through extensive experiments on various styles, we demonstrate that our method is effective and robust regarding both single-view stylization quality and cross-view consistency.

The standard approach to constructing neural radiance fields takes advantage of multi-view consistency and requires many calibrated views of a scene, a requirement that cannot be satisfied when learning on large-scale image data in the wild. We take a step towards addressing this shortcoming by introducing a model that encodes the input image into a disentangled object representation that contains a code for object shape, a code for object appearance, and an estimated camera pose from which the object image is captured. Our model conditions a NeRF on the predicted object representation and uses volume rendering to generate images from novel views. We train the model end-to-end on a large collection of input images. As the model is only provided with single-view images, the problem is highly under-constrained. Therefore, in addition to using a reconstruction loss on the synthesized input view, we use an auxiliary adversarial loss on the novel rendered views. Furthermore, we leverage object symmetry and cycle camera pose consistency.

Our algorithm starts from the separate training of one RTRBM for a source speaker and another for a target speaker using speaker-dependent training data. Because each RTRBM attempts to discover abstractions to maximally express the training data at each time step, as well as the temporal dependencies in the training data, we expect that the models represent the linguistic-related latent features in high-order spaces. In our approach, we convert (match) features of emphasis for the source speaker to those of the target speaker using a neural network (NN), so that the entire network (consisting of the two RTRBMs and the NN) acts as a deep recurrent NN and can be fine-tuned.

The proposed network is not conditioned on the text or on the notes, and it directly converts the audio of one singer to the voice of another. Training is performed without any form of supervision: no lyrics or any kind of phonetic features, no notes, and no matching samples between singers. The proposed network employs a single CNN encoder for all singers, a single WaveNet decoder, and a classifier that enforces the latent representation to be singer-agnostic. Each singer is represented by one embedding vector, which the decoder is conditioned on. In order to deal with relatively small datasets, we propose a new data augmentation scheme, as well as new training losses and protocols that are based on backtranslation. Our evaluation presents evidence that the conversion produces natural signing voices that are highly recognizable as the target singer.",

Our approach takes RGB images of a dynamic scene as input (e.g., from a monocular video recording), and creates a high-quality space-time geometry and appearance representation. We show that a single handheld consumer-grade camera is sufficient to synthesize sophisticated renderings of a dynamic scene from novel virtual camera views, e.g. a `bullet-time' video effect. NR-NeRF disentangles the dynamic scene into a canonical volume and its deformation. Scene deformation is implemented as ray bending, where straight rays are deformed non-rigidly. We also propose a novel rigidity network to better constrain rigid regions of the scene, leading to more stable results. The ray bending and rigidity network are trained without explicit supervision. Our formulation enables dense correspondence estimation across views and time, and compelling video editing applications such as motion exaggeration. Our code will be open sourced.",

A comparative study of voice conversion using an ANN model and the state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is conducted. The results of voice conversion, evaluated using subjective and objective measures, confirm that an ANN-based VC system performs as good as that of a GMM-based VC system, and the quality of the transformed speech is intelligible and possesses the characteristics of a target speaker. In this paper, we also address the issue of dependency of voice conversion techniques on parallel data between the source and the target speakers. While there have been efforts to use nonparallel data and speaker adaptation techniques, it is important to investigate techniques which capture speaker-specific characteristics of a target speaker, and avoid any need for source speaker's data either for training or for adaptation. In this paper, we propose a voice conversion approach using an ANN model to capture speaker-specific characteristics of a target speaker and demonstrate that such a voice conversion approach can perform monolingual as well as cross-lingual voice conversion of an arbitrary source speaker.",

        "content1": "Open-domain human-computer conversation has attracted much attention in the field of NLP. Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information. The generated reply is then fed back as a new candidate for post-reranking. Experimental results show that such ensemble outperforms each single part of it by a large margin.",

Before sharing a NeRF, though, it might be desirable to remove personal information or unsightly objects. Such removal is not easily achieved with the current NeRF editing frameworks. We propose a framework to remove objects from a NeRF representation created from an RGB-D sequence. Our NeRF inpainting method leverages recent work in 2D image inpainting and is guided by a user-provided mask. Our algorithm is underpinned by a confidence based view selection procedure. It chooses which of the individual 2D inpainted images to use in the creation of the NeRF, so that the resulting inpainted NeRF is 3D consistent. We show that our method for NeRF editing is effective for synthesizing plausible inpaintings in a multi-view coherent manner, outperforming competing methods. We validate our approach by proposing a new and still-challenging dataset for the task of NeRF inpainting.",

        "content1": "Evaluating open-domain dialogue systems is difficult due to the diversity of possible correct answers. Automatic metrics such as BLEU correlate weakly with human annotations, resulting in a significant bias across different models and datasets. Some researchers resort to human judgment experimentation for assessing response quality, which is expensive, time consuming, and not scalable. Moreover, judges tend to evaluate a small number of dialogues, meaning that minor differences in evaluation configuration may lead to dissimilar results. In this paper, we present interpretable metrics for evaluating topic coherence by making use of distributed sentence representations. Furthermore, we introduce calculable approximations of human judgment based on conversational coherence by adopting state-of-the-art entailment techniques. Results show that our metrics can be used as a surrogate for human judgment, making it easy to evaluate dialogue systems on large-scale datasets and allowing an unbiased estimate for the quality of the responses.",

The response of knowledge grounded conversation might contain multiple answer entities or no entity at all.

We propose a fully data-driven generative dialogue system GenDS that is capable of generating responses based on input message and related knowledge base (KB). To generate arbitrary number of answer entities even when these entities never appear in the training set, we design a dynamic knowledge enquirer which selects different answer entities at different positions in a single response, according to different local context. It does not rely on the representations of entities, enabling our model deal with out-of-vocabulary entities. We collect a human-human conversation data (ConversMusic) with knowledge annotations. The proposed method is evaluated on CoversMusic and a public question answering dataset.

DeBi-HMM is named for its duration-embedded characteristic of the two HMMs for modeling the source and target speech signals, respectively. Joint estimation of source and target HMMs is exploited for spectrum conversion from neutral to expressive speech. Gamma distribution is embedded as the duration model for each state in source and target HMMs. The expressive style-dependent decision trees achieve prosodic conversion. The STRAIGHT algorithm is adopted for the analysis and synthesis process. A set of small-sized speech databases for each expressive style is designed and collected to train the DeBi-HMM voice conversion models. Several experiments with statistical hypothesis testing are conducted to evaluate the quality of synthetic speech as perceived by human subjects.

        "content1": "This paper presents a new spectral envelope conversion method using deep neural networks (DNNs). The conventional joint density Gaussian mixture model (JDGMM) based spectral conversion methods perform stably and effectively. However, the speech generated by these methods suffer severe quality degradation due to the following two factors: 1) inadequacy of JDGMM in modeling the distribution of spectral features as well as the non-linear mapping relationship between the source and target speakers, 2) spectral detail loss caused by the use of high-level spectral features such as mel-cepstra. Previously, we have proposed to use the mixture of restricted Boltzmann machines (MoRBM) and the mixture of Gaussian bidirectional associative memories (MoGBAM) to cope with these problems. In this paper, we propose to use a DNN to construct a global non-linear mapping relationship between the spectral envelopes of two speakers. The proposed DNN is generatively trained by cascading two RBMs, which model the distributions of spectral envelopes of source and target speakers respectively, using a Bernoulli BAM (BBAM). Therefore, the proposed training method takes the advantage of the strong modeling ability of RBMs in modeling the distribution of spectral envelopes and the superiority of BAMs in deriving the conditional distributions for conversion. Careful comparisons and analysis among the proposed method and some conventional methods are presented in this paper. The subjective results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance in terms of both similarity and naturalness compared to conventional methods.",

        "content1": "This paper proposes an any-to-many location-relative, sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq), non-parallel voice conversion approach, which utilizes text supervision during training. In this approach, we combine a bottle-neck feature extractor (BNE) with a seq2seq synthesis module. During the training stage, an encoder-decoder-based hybrid connectionist-temporal-classification-attention (CTC-attention) phoneme recognizer is trained, whose encoder has a bottle-neck layer. A BNE is obtained from the phoneme recognizer and is utilized to extract speaker-independent, dense and rich spoken content representations from spectral features. Then a multi-speaker location-relative attention based seq2seq synthesis model is trained to reconstruct spectral features from the bottle-neck features, conditioning on speaker representations for speaker identity control in the generated speech. To mitigate the difficulties of using seq2seq models to align long sequences, we down-sample the input spectral feature along the temporal dimension and equip the synthesis model with a discretized mixture of logistic (MoL) attention mechanism. Since the phoneme recognizer is trained with large speech recognition data corpus, the proposed approach can conduct any-to-many voice conversion. Objective and subjective evaluations show that the proposed any-to-many approach has superior voice conversion performance in terms of both naturalness and speaker similarity. Ablation studies are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of feature selection and model design strategies in the proposed approach. The proposed VC approach can readily be extended to support any-to-any VC (also known as one/few-shot VC), and achieve high performance according to objective and subjective evaluations.",

However, a successful reconstruction from RGB images requires a large number of input views taken under static conditions - typically up to a few hundred images for room-size scenes. Our method aims to synthesize novel views of whole rooms from an order of magnitude fewer images. To this end, we leverage dense depth priors in order to constrain the NeRF optimization. First, we take advantage of the sparse depth data that is freely available from the structure from motion (SfM) preprocessing step used to estimate camera poses. Second, we use depth completion to convert these sparse points into dense depth maps and uncertainty estimates, which are used to guide NeRF optimization. Our method enables data-efficient novel view synthesis on challenging indoor scenes, using as few as 18 images for an entire scene.",

One recent popular approach is to train end-to-end models on a large amount of real dialog transcripts between humans (Sordoni et al., 2015; Vinyals & Le, 2015; Shang et al., 2015). However, this approach leaves many questions unanswered as an understanding of the precise successes and shortcomings of each model is hard to assess. A contrasting recent proposal are the bAbI tasks (Weston et al., 2015b) which are synthetic data that measure the ability of learning machines at various reasoning tasks over toy language. Unfortunately, those tests are very small and hence may encourage methods that do not scale. In this work, we propose a suite of new tasks of a much larger scale that attempt to bridge the gap between the two regimes. Choosing the domain of movies, we provide tasks that test the ability of models to answer factual questions (utilizing OMDB), provide personalization (utilizing MovieLens), carry short conversations about the two, and finally to perform on natural dialogs from Reddit. We provide a dataset covering 75k movie entities and with 3.5M training examples. We present results of various models on these tasks, and evaluate their performance.",

While achieving compelling results, most approaches operate in the two-dimensional image domain, ignoring the three-dimensional nature of our world. Several recent works therefore propose generative models which are 3D-aware, i.e., scenes are modeled in 3D and then rendered differentiably to the image plane. While this leads to impressive 3D consistency, the camera needs to be modelled as well and we show in this work that these methods are sensitive to the choice of prior camera distributions. Current approaches assume fixed intrinsics and predefined priors over camera pose ranges, and parameter tuning is typically required for real-world data. If the data distribution is not matched, results degrade significantly. Our key hypothesis is that learning a camera generator jointly with the image generator leads to a more principled approach to 3D-aware image synthesis. Further, we propose to decompose the scene into a background and foreground model, leading to more efficient and disentangled scene representations. While training from raw, unposed image collections, we learn a 3D- and camera-aware generative model which faithfully recovers not only the image but also the camera data distribution. At test time, our model generates images with explicit control over the camera as well as the shape and appearance of the scene.",

        "content1": "In this paper, we propose to use deep policy networks which are trained with an advantage actor-critic method for statistically optimised dialogue systems. First, we show that, on summary state and action spaces, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) outperforms Gaussian Processes methods. Summary state and action spaces lead to good performance but require pre-engineering effort, RL knowledge, and domain expertise. In order to remove the need to define such summary spaces, we show that deep RL can also be trained efficiently on the original state and action spaces. Dialogue systems based on partially observable Markov decision processes are known to require many dialogues to train, which makes them unappealing for practical deployment. We show that a deep RL method based on an actor-critic architecture can exploit a small amount of data very efficiently. Indeed, with only a few hundred dialogues collected with a handcrafted policy, the actor-critic deep learner is considerably bootstrapped from a combination of supervised and batch RL. In addition, convergence to an optimal policy is significantly sped up compared to other deep RL methods initialized on the data with batch RL. All experiments are performed on a restaurant domain derived from the Dialogue State Tracking Challenge 2 (DSTC2) dataset.",

        "content1": "Recently there are increasing concerns about the fairness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in real-world applications such as computer vision and recommendations. For example, recognition algorithms in computer vision are unfair to black people such as poorly detecting their faces and inappropriately identifying them as \"gorillas\". As one crucial application of AI, dialogue systems have been extensively applied in our society. They are usually built with real human conversational data; thus they could inherit some fairness issues which are held in the real world. However, the fairness of dialogue systems has not been well investigated. In this paper, we perform a pioneering study about the fairness issues in dialogue systems. In particular, we construct a benchmark dataset and propose quantitative measures to understand fairness in dialogue models. Our studies demonstrate that popular dialogue models show significant prejudice towards different genders and races. Besides, to mitigate the bias in dialogue systems, we propose two simple but effective debiasing methods. Experiments show that our methods can reduce the bias in dialogue systems significantly. The dataset and the implementation are released to foster fairness research in dialogue systems.",

        "content1": "Recent progress on multi-view 3D object reconstruction has featured neural implicit surfaces via learning high-fidelity radiance fields. However, most approaches hinge on the visual hull derived from cost-expensive silhouette masks to obtain object surfaces. In this paper, we propose a novel Object-aware Radiance Fields (ORF) to automatically learn an object-aware geometry reconstruction. The geometric correspondences between multi-view 2D object regions and 3D implicit/explicit object surfaces are additionally exploited to boost the learning of object surfaces. Technically, a critical transparency discriminator is designed to distinguish the object-intersected and object-bypassed rays based on the estimated 2D object regions, leading to 3D implicit object surfaces. Such implicit surfaces can be directly converted into explicit object surfaces (e.g., meshes) via marching cubes. Then, we build the geometric correspondence between 2D planes and 3D meshes by rasterization, and project the estimated object regions into 3D explicit object surfaces by aggregating the object information across multiple views. The aggregated object information in 3D explicit object surfaces is further reprojected back to 2D planes, aiming to update 2D object regions and enforce them to be multi-view consistent. Extensive experiments on DTU and BlendedMVS verify the capability of ORF to produce comparable surfaces against the state-of-the-art models that demand silhouette masks.",

Yet, generating these images is very computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a technique based on spatial decomposition capable of mitigating this issue. Our key observation is that there are diminishing returns in employing larger (deeper and/or wider) networks. Hence, we propose to spatially decompose a scene and dedicate smaller networks for each decomposed part. When working together, these networks can render the whole scene. This allows us near-constant inference time regardless of the number of decomposed parts. Moreover, we show that a Voronoi spatial decomposition is preferable for this purpose, as it is provably compatible with the Painter's Algorithm for efficient and GPU-friendly rendering. Our experiments show that for real-world scenes, our method provides up to 3x more efficient inference than NeRF (with the same rendering quality), or an improvement of up to 1.0 dB in PSNR (for the same inference cost).",

However, in some practical situations, such as cross-lingual voice conversion, it is not possible to obtain such parallel utterances. With an aim towards increasing the versatility of current voice conversion systems, this paper proposes a new iterative alignment method that allows pairing phonetically equivalent acoustic vectors from nonparallel utterances from different speakers, even under cross-lingual conditions.

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has become a popular framework for learning implicit 3D representations and addressing different tasks such as novel-view synthesis or depth-map estimation. However, in downstream applications where decisions need to be made based on automatic predictions, it is critical to leverage the confidence associated with the model estimations. Whereas uncertainty quantification is a long-standing problem in Machine Learning, it has been largely overlooked in the recent NeRF literature. In this context, we propose Stochastic Neural Radiance Fields (S-NeRF), a generalization of standard NeRF that learns a probability distribution over all the possible radiance fields modeling the scene. This distribution allows to quantify the uncertainty associated with the scene information provided by the model.

MinTL is a simple yet effective transfer learning framework, which allows us to plug-and-play pre-trained seq2seq models, and jointly learn dialogue state tracking and dialogue response generation. Unlike previous approaches, which use a copy mechanism to \"carryover\" the old dialogue states to the new one, we introduce Levenshtein belief spans (Lev), that allows efficient dialogue state tracking with a minimal generation length. We instantiate our learning framework with two pre-trained backbones: T5 and BART, and evaluate them on MultiWOZ. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: 1) our systems establish new state-of-the-art results on end-to-end response generation, 2) MinTL-based systems are more robust than baseline methods in the low resource setting, and they achieve competitive results with only 20\\% training data, and 3) Lev greatly improves the inference efficiency.",

        "content1": "The objective of voice conversion algorithms is to modify the speech by a particular source speaker so that it sounds as if spoken by a different target speaker. Current conversion algorithms employ a training procedure, during which the same utterances spoken by both the source and target speakers are needed for deriving the desired conversion parameters. Such a (parallel) corpus, is often difficult or impossible to collect. Here, we propose an algorithm that relaxes this constraint, i.e., the training corpus does not necessarily contain the same utterances from both speakers. The proposed algorithm is based on speaker adaptation techniques, adapting the conversion parameters derived for a particular pair of speakers to a different pair, for which only a nonparallel corpus is available. We show that adaptation reduces the error obtained when simply applying the conversion parameters of one pair of speakers to another by a factor that can reach 30%. A speaker identification measure is also employed that more insightfully portrays the importance of adaptation, while listening tests confirm the success of our method. Both the objective and subjective tests employed, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable results with the ideal case when a parallel corpus is available.",

Since intrinsic decomposition is a fundamentally under-constrained inverse problem, we propose a novel distance-aware point sampling and adaptive reflectance iterative clustering optimization method, which enables IntrinsicNeRF with traditional intrinsic decomposition constraints to be trained in an unsupervised manner, resulting in multi-view consistent intrinsic decomposition results. To cope with the problem that different adjacent instances of similar reflectance in a scene are incorrectly clustered together, we further propose a hierarchical clustering method with coarse-to-fine optimization to obtain a fast hierarchical indexing representation. It supports compelling real-time augmented applications such as recoloring and illumination variation. Extensive experiments and editing samples on both object-specific/room-scale scenes and synthetic/real-word data demonstrate that we can obtain consistent intrinsic decomposition results and high-fidelity novel view synthesis even for challenging sequences.",

One recent popular approach is to train end-to-end models on a large amount of real dialog transcripts between humans (Sordoni et al., 2015; Vinyals & Le, 2015; Shang et al., 2015). However, this approach leaves many questions unanswered as an understanding of the precise successes and shortcomings of each model is hard to assess. A contrasting recent proposal are the bAbI tasks (Weston et al., 2015b) which are synthetic data that measure the ability of learning machines at various reasoning tasks over toy language. Unfortunately, those tests are very small and hence may encourage methods that do not scale. In this work, we propose a suite of new tasks of a much larger scale that attempt to bridge the gap between the two regimes.

The idea is to bridge between speakers by means of Phonetic PosteriorGrams (PPGs) obtained from a speaker-independent automatic speech recognition (SI-ASR) system. It is assumed that these PPGs can represent articulation of speech sounds in a speaker-normalized space and correspond to spoken content speaker-independently. The proposed approach first obtains PPGs of target speech. Then, a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Recurrent Neural Network (DBLSTM) structure is used to model the relationships between the PPGs and acoustic features of the target speech. To convert arbitrary source speech, we obtain its PPGs from the same SI-ASR and feed them into the trained DBLSTM for generating converted speech. Our approach has two main advantages: 1) no parallel training data is required; 2) a trained model can be applied to any other source speaker for a fixed target speaker (i.e., many-to-one conversion). Experiments show that our approach performs equally well or better than state-of-the-art systems in both speech quality and speaker similarity.",

        "content1": "In this letter, we tackle the problem of active robotic 3D reconstruction of an object. In particular, we study how a mobile robot with an arm-held camera can select a favorable number of views to recover an object's 3D shape efficiently. Contrary to the existing solution to this problem, we leverage the popular neural radiance fields-based object representation, which has recently shown impressive results for various computer vision tasks. However, it is not straightforward to directly reason about an object's explicit 3D geometric details using such a representation, making the next-best-view selection problem for dense 3D reconstruction challenging. This paper introduces a ray-based volumetric uncertainty estimator, which computes the entropy of the weight distribution of the color samples along each ray of the object's implicit neural representation. We show that it is possible to infer the uncertainty of the underlying 3D geometry given a novel view with the proposed estimator. We then present a next-best-view selection policy guided by the ray-based volumetric uncertainty in neural radiance fields-based representations. Encouraging experimental results on synthetic and real-world data suggest that the approach presented in this paper can enable a new research direction of using an implicit 3D object representation for the next-best-view problem in robot vision applications, distinguishing our approach from the existing approaches that rely on explicit 3D geometric modeling.",

So far, most of the voice conversion studies mainly focus only on the speech voice conversion that is different from singing voice conversion. We note that singing conveys both lexical and emotional information through words and tones. It is one of the most expressive components in music and a means of entertainment as well as self expression. In this paper, we propose a novel singing voice conversion framework, that is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The proposed GAN-based conversion framework, that we call SINGAN, consists of two neural networks: a discriminator to distinguish natural and converted singing voice, and a generator to deceive the discriminator. With GAN, we minimize the differences of the distributions between the original target parameters and the generated singing parameters. To our best knowledge, this is the first framework that uses generative adversarial networks for singing voice conversion. In experiments, we show that the proposed method effectively converts singing voices and outperforms the baseline approach.",

The benefits and flexibility of the proposed methodology have been validated by developing statistical dialog managers for four spoken dialog systems of different complexity, designed for different languages (English, Italian, and Spanish) and application domains (from transactional to problem-solving tasks).

This is in large part due to the rapidly growing market demand for dialogue agents capable of goal-oriented behaviour. Due to the business process nature of these conversations, end-to-end machine learning systems are generally not a viable option, as the generated dialogue agents must be deployable and verifiable on behalf of the businesses authoring them.\n  In this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the creation of goal-oriented complex dialogue systems that dramatically eliminates the need for a designer to manually specify a dialogue tree, which nearly all current systems have to resort to when the interaction pattern falls outside standard patterns such as slot filling. We propose a declarative representation of the dialogue agent to be processed by state-of-the-art planning technology. Our proposed approach covers all aspects of the process; from model solicitation to the execution of the generated plans/dialogue agents.

        "content1": "Pose-free neural radiance fields (NeRF) aim to train NeRF with unposed multi-view images and it has achieved very impressive success in recent years. Most existing works share the pipeline of training a coarse pose estimator with rendered images at first, followed by a joint optimization of estimated poses and neural radiance field. However, as the pose estimator is trained with only rendered images, the pose estimation is usually biased or inaccurate for real images due to the domain gap between real images and rendered images, leading to poor robustness for the pose estimation of real images and further local min- ima in joint optimization. We design IR-NeRF, an innovative pose-free NeRF that introduces implicit pose regularization to refine pose estimator with unposed real images and improve the robustness of the pose estimation for real images. With a collection of 2D images of a specific scene, IR-NeRF constructs a scene codebook that stores scene features and captures the scene-specific pose distribution implicitly as priors. Thus, the robustness of pose estimation can be promoted with the scene priors according to the rationale that a 2D real image can be well reconstructed from the scene codebook only when its estimated pose lies within the pose distribution. Extensive experiments show that IR-NeRF achieves superior novel view synthesis and outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently across multiple synthetic and real datasets.",

More than one hundred male and female participants with 1st or non-1st English language, age range 13–64, interacted with the systems over the Internet scoring each for conversation ability. Developers of the modern conversation systems show they deploy a variety of techniques to initiate and maintain dialogue learning from interactions with humans over the Internet. Statistical significance shows these dialogue systems are an improvement on their predecessor. Embedded on the web affording round-the-clock interaction the nature of artificial dialogue systems is evolving as these systems learn from the way humans converse. The uses of modern Elizas are proven successful as virtual assistants in e-commerce; their conversational basis is already extending into education. What we can say is modern artificial dialogue systems do talk.

        "content1": "In a spoken dialog system, determining which action a machine should take in a given situation is a difficult problem because automatic speech recognition is unreliable and hence the state of the conversation can never be known with certainty. Much of the research in spoken dialog systems centres on mitigating this uncertainty and recent work has focussed on three largely disparate techniques: parallel dialog state hypotheses, local use of confidence scores, and automated planning. While in isolation each of these approaches can improve action selection, taken together they currently lack a unified statistical framework that admits global optimization. In this paper we cast a spoken dialog system as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We show how this formulation unifies and extends existing techniques to form a single principled framework. A number of illustrations are used to show qualitatively the potential benefits of POMDPs compared to existing techniques, and empirical results from dialog simulations are presented which demonstrate significant quantitative gains. Finally, some of the key challenges to advancing this method – in particular scalability – are briefly outlined.",

However, it is difficult to reconstruct a sharp NeRF from blurry input as often occurred in the wild. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Event-Enhanced NeRF (E2NeRF) by utilizing the combination data of a bio-inspired event camera and a standard RGB camera. To effectively introduce event stream into the learning process of neural volumetric representation, we propose a blur rendering loss and an event rendering loss, which guide the network via modelling real blur process and event generation process, respectively. Moreover, a camera pose estimation framework for real-world data is built with the guidance of event stream to generalize the method to practical applications. In contrast to previous image-based or event-based NeRF, our framework effectively utilizes the internal relationship between events and images. As a result, E2NeRF not only achieves image deblurring but also achieves high-quality novel view image generation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate that E2NeRF can effectively learn a sharp NeRF from blurry images, especially in complex and low-light scenes.

First, a multi-task learning structure is designed which adds auxiliary classifiers to the middle layers of the seq2seq model and predicts linguistic labels as a secondary task. Second, a data-augmentation method is proposed which utilizes text alignment to produce extra parallel sequences for model training. Experiments are conducted to evaluate our proposed method with training sets at different sizes. Experimental results show that the multi-task learning with linguistic labels is effective at reducing the errors of seq2seq voice conversion.

The efficacy of DoubleField is validated by the quantitative evaluations on several datasets and the qualitative results in a real-world sparse multi-view system, showing its superior capability for high-quality human model reconstruction and photo-realistic free-viewpoint human rendering.

Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information. The generated reply is then fed back as a new candidate for post-reranking. Experimental results show that such ensemble outperforms each single part of it by a large margin.",

CLA-NeRF is trained at the object category level using no CAD models and no depth, but a set of RGB images with ground truth camera poses and part segments. During inference, it only takes a few RGB views (i.e., few-shot) of an unseen 3D object instance within the known category to infer the object part segmentation and the neural radiance field. Given an articulated pose as input, CLA-NeRF can perform articulation-aware volume rendering to generate the corresponding RGB image at any camera pose. Moreover, the articulated pose of an object can be estimated via inverse rendering. In our experiments, we evaluate the framework across five categories on both synthetic and real-world data. In all cases, our method shows realistic deformation results and accurate articulated pose estimation. We believe that both few-shot articulated object rendering and articulated pose estimation open doors for robots to perceive and interact with unseen articulated objects.",

        "content1": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has become a popular framework for learning implicit 3D representations and addressing different tasks such as novel-view synthesis or depth-map estimation. However, in downstream applications where decisions need to be made based on automatic predictions, it is critical to leverage the confidence associated with the model estimations. Whereas uncertainty quantification is a long-standing problem in Machine Learning, it has been largely overlooked in the recent NeRF literature. In this context, we propose Stochastic Neural Radiance Fields (S-NeRF), a generalization of standard NeRF that learns a probability distribution over all the possible radiance fields modeling the scene. This distribution allows to quantify the uncertainty associated with the scene information provided by the model. S-NeRF optimization is posed as a Bayesian learning problem that is efficiently addressed using the Variational Inference framework. Exhaustive experiments over benchmark datasets demonstrate that S-NeRF is able to provide more reliable predictions and confidence values than generic approaches previously proposed for uncertainty estimation in other domains.",

Thus far, NeRF and its variants have ignored these cases. However, since the NeRF framework is based on volumetric rendering, it has inherent capability to account for the medium's effects, once modeled appropriately. We develop a new rendering model for NeRFs in scattering media, which is based on the SeaThru image formation model, and suggest a suitable architecture for learning both scene information and medium parameters. We demonstrate the strength of our method using simulated and real-world scenes, correctly rendering novel photorealistic views underwater. Even more excitingly, we can render clear views of these scenes, removing the medium between the camera and the scene and reconstructing the appearance and depth of far objects, which are severely occluded by the medium.

We explore the possibility of creating dialogue data through the interaction between a dialogue system and a user simulator. Our goal is to develop a modelling framework that can incorporate new dialogue scenarios through self-play between the two agents. In this framework, we first pre-train the two agents on a collection of source domain dialogues, which equips the agents to converse with each other via natural language. With further fine-tuning on a small amount of target domain data, the agents continue to interact with the aim of improving their behaviors using reinforcement learning with structured reward functions. In experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, two practical transfer learning problems are investigated: 1) domain adaptation and 2) single-to-multiple domain transfer. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is highly effective in bootstrapping the performance of the two agents in transfer learning. We also show that our method leads to improvements in dialogue system performance on complete datasets.",

Joint estimation of source and target HMMs is exploited for spectrum conversion from neutral to expressive speech.

        "content1": "Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have demonstrated the potential of coordinate-based neural representation (neural fields or implicit neural representation) in neural rendering. However, using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to represent a 3D scene or object requires enormous computational resources and time. There have been recent studies on how to reduce these computational inefficiencies by using additional data structures, such as grids or trees. Despite the promising performance, the explicit data structure necessitates a substantial amount of memory. In this work, we present a method to reduce the size without compromising the advantages of having additional data structures. In detail, we propose using the wavelet transform on grid-based neural fields. Grid-based neural fields are for fast convergence, and the wavelet transform, whose efficiency has been demonstrated in high-performance standard codecs, is to improve the parameter efficiency of grids. Furthermore, in order to achieve a higher sparsity of grid coefficients while maintaining reconstruction quality, we present a novel trainable masking approach. Experimental results demonstrate that non-spatial grid coefficients, such as wavelet coefficients, are capable of attaining a higher level of sparsity than spatial grid coefficients, resulting in a more compact representation. With our proposed mask and compression pipeline, we achieved state-of-the-art performance within a memory budget of 2 MB. Our code is available at https://github.com/daniel03c1/masked_wavelet_nerf.",

Our method enables pausing the video at any frame and rendering all scene details (dynamic humans, objects, and backgrounds) from arbitrary viewpoints. The first challenge in this task is the complex object motions in human-object interactions, which we tackle by introducing the new object bones into the conventional human skeleton hierarchy to effectively estimate large object deformations in our dynamic human-object model. The second challenge is that humans interact with different objects at different times, for which we introduce two new learnable object state embeddings that can be used as conditions for learning our human-object representation and scene representation, respectively. Extensive experiments show that HOSNeRF significantly outperforms SOTA approaches on two challenging datasets by a large margin of 40%   50% in terms of LPIPS.

NeRFs have been shown to be remarkably effective for the task of view synthesis — synthesizing photorealistic novel views of real-world scenes or objects. In this work, we investigate whether we can apply analysis-by-synthesis via NeRF for mesh-free, RGB-only 6DoF pose estimation – given an image, find the translation and rotation of a camera relative to a 3D object or scene. Our method assumes that no object mesh models are available during either training or test time. Starting from an initial pose estimate, we use gradient descent to minimize the residual between pixels rendered from a NeRF and pixels in an observed image. In our experiments, we first study 1) how to sample rays during pose refinement for iNeRF to collect informative gradients and 2) how different batch sizes of rays affect iNeRF on a synthetic dataset. We then show that for complex real-world scenes from the LLFF dataset [21], iNeRF can improve NeRF by estimating the camera poses of novel images and using these images as additional training data for NeRF. Finally, we show iNeRF can perform categorylevel object pose estimation, including object instances not seen during training, with RGB images by inverting a NeRF model inferred from a single view.",

The task is especially appealing when only a few or even single RGB cameras are used for capturing the dynamic scene. To this end, we present an efficient framework capable of fast reconstruction, compact modeling, and streamable rendering. First, we propose to decompose the 4D spatiotemporal space according to temporal characteristics. Points in the 4D space are associated with probabilities of belonging to three categories: static, deforming, and new areas. Each area is represented and regularized by a separate neural field. Second, we propose a hybrid representations based feature streaming scheme for efficiently modeling the neural fields. Our approach, coined NeRFPlayer, is evaluated on dynamic scenes captured by single hand-held cameras and multi-camera arrays, achieving comparable or superior rendering performance in terms of quality and speed comparable to recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving reconstruction in 10 seconds per frame and interactive rendering.

        "content1": "Pose-free neural radiance fields (NeRF) aim to train NeRF with unposed multi-view images and it has achieved very impressive success in recent years. Most existing works share the pipeline of training a coarse pose estimator with rendered images at first, followed by a joint optimization of estimated poses and neural radiance field. However, as the pose estimator is trained with only rendered images, the pose estimation is usually biased or inaccurate for real images due to the domain gap between real images and rendered images, leading to poor robustness for the pose estimation of real images and further local min- ima in joint optimization. We design IR-NeRF, an innovative pose-free NeRF that introduces implicit pose regularization to refine pose estimator with unposed real images and improve the robustness of the pose estimation for real images. With a collection of 2D images of a specific scene, IR-NeRF constructs a scene codebook that stores scene features and captures the scene-specific pose distribution implicitly as priors. Thus, the robustness of pose estimation can be promoted with the scene priors according to the rationale that a 2D real image can be well reconstructed from the scene codebook only when its estimated pose lies within the pose distribution. Extensive experiments show that IR-NeRF achieves superior novel view synthesis and outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently across multiple synthetic and real datasets.",

This is in large part due to the rapidly growing market demand for dialogue agents capable of goal-oriented behaviour. Due to the business process nature of these conversations, end-to-end machine learning systems are generally not a viable option, as the generated dialogue agents must be deployable and verifiable on behalf of the businesses authoring them.\n  In this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the creation of goal-oriented complex dialogue systems that dramatically eliminates the need for a designer to manually specify a dialogue tree, which nearly all current systems have to resort to when the interaction pattern falls outside standard patterns such as slot filling. We propose a declarative representation of the dialogue agent to be processed by state-of-the-art planning technology. Our proposed approach covers all aspects of the process; from model solicitation to the execution of the generated plans/dialogue agents. Along the way, we introduce novel planning encodings for declarative dialogue synthesis, a variety of interfaces for working with the specification as a dialogue architect, and a robust executor for generalized contingent plans. We have created prototype implementations of all components, and in this paper, we further demonstrate the resulting system empirically.",

Recently, CycleGAN-VC has provided a breakthrough and performed comparably to a parallel VC method without relying on any extra data, modules, or time alignment procedures. However, there is still a large gap between the real target and converted speech, and bridging this gap remains a challenge. To reduce the gap, we propose CycleGAN-VC2, which is an improved version of CycleGAN-VC incorporating three new techniques: an improved objective (two-step adversarial losses), improved generator (2-1-2D CNN), and improved discriminator (PatchGAN). We evaluated our method on a non-parallel VC task and analyzed the effect of each technique in detail. An objective evaluation showed that these techniques help bring the converted feature sequence closer to the target in terms of both global and local structures, which we assess by using Mel-cepstral distortion and modulation spectra distance, respectively.

Point-NeRF combines the advantages of these two approaches by using neural 3D point clouds, with associated neural features, to model a radiance field. Point-NeRF can be rendered efficiently by aggregating neural point features near scene surfaces, in a ray marching-based rendering pipeline. Moreover, Point-NeRF can be initialized via direct inference of a pre-trained deep network to produce a neural point cloud; this point cloud can be fine-tuned to surpass the visual quality of NeRF with 30X faster training time. Point-NeRF can be combined with other 3D reconstruction methods and handles the errors and outliers in such methods via a novel pruning and growing mechanism.",

To this end, we present an efficient framework capable of fast reconstruction, compact modeling, and streamable rendering. First, we propose to decompose the 4D spatiotemporal space according to temporal characteristics. Points in the 4D space are associated with probabilities of belonging to three categories: static, deforming, and new areas. Each area is represented and regularized by a separate neural field. Second, we propose a hybrid representations based feature streaming scheme for efficiently modeling the neural fields. Our approach, coined NeRFPlayer, is evaluated on dynamic scenes captured by single hand-held cameras and multi-camera arrays, achieving comparable or superior rendering performance in terms of quality and speed comparable to recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving reconstruction in 10 seconds per frame and interactive rendering.

        "content1": "This paper presents a voice conversion (VC) method that utilizes the recently proposed probabilistic models called recurrent temporal restricted Boltzmann machines (RTRBMs). One RTRBM is used for each speaker, with the goal of capturing high-order temporal dependencies in an acoustic sequence. Our algorithm starts from the separate training of one RTRBM for a source speaker and another for a target speaker using speaker-dependent training data. Because each RTRBM attempts to discover abstractions to maximally express the training data at each time step, as well as the temporal dependencies in the training data, we expect that the models represent the linguistic-related latent features in high-order spaces. In our approach, we convert (match) features of emphasis for the source speaker to those of the target speaker using a neural network (NN), so that the entire network (consisting of the two RTRBMs and the NN) acts as a deep recurrent NN and can be fine-tuned. Using VC experiments, we confirm the high performance of our method, especially in terms of objective criteria, relative to conventional VC methods such as approaches based on Gaussian mixture models and on NNs.",
        "content2": "During the past decade, several areas of speech and language understanding have witnessed substantial breakthroughs from the use of data-driven models. In the area of dialogue systems, the trend is less obvious, and most practical systems are still built through significant engineering and expert knowledge. Nevertheless, several recent results suggest that data-driven approaches are feasible and quite promising. To facilitate research in this area, we have carried out a wide survey of publicly available datasets suitable for data-driven learning of dialogue systems. We discuss important characteristics of these datasets, how they can be used to learn diverse dialogue strategies, and their other potential uses. We also examine methods for transfer learning between datasets and the use of external knowledge. Finally, we discuss appropriate choice of evaluation metrics for the learning objective.",

Our approach exploits multi-view geometry constraints in order to jointly learn the NeRF and refine the camera poses. By relying on pixel matches extracted between the input views, our multi-view correspondence objective enforces the optimized scene and camera poses to converge to a global and geometrically accurate solution.

While preserving the common characteristics of a given input condition, the proposed model generates diverse images in fine detail. We propose: 1) a novel unified architecture which disentangles the shape and appearance from a condition given in various forms and 2) the pose-consistent diversity loss for generating multimodal outputs while maintaining consistency of the view. Experimental results show that the proposed method maintains consistent image quality on various condition types and achieves superior fidelity and diversity compared to existing NeRF-based generative models.",

In this framework, we first pre-train the two agents on a collection of source domain dialogues, which equips the agents to converse with each other via natural language. With further fine-tuning on a small amount of target domain data, the agents continue to interact with the aim of improving their behaviors using reinforcement learning with structured reward functions. In experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, two practical transfer learning problems are investigated: 1) domain adaptation and 2) single-to-multiple domain transfer.

We compared the proposed method to existing methods using Gaussian mixture models and frame-selection. We evaluated the methods objectively, and also conducted perceptual experiments to measure both the conversion accuracy and speech quality of selected systems.

        "content1": "In Voice Conversion (VC), the speech of a source speaker is modified to resemble that of a particular target speaker. Currently, standard VC approaches use Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based transformations that do not generate high-quality converted speech due to “over-smoothing” resulting from weak links between individual source and target frame parameters. Dynamic Frequency Warping (DFW) offers an appealing alternative to GMM-based methods, as more spectral details are maintained in transformation; however, the speaker timbre is less successfully converted because spectral power is not adjusted explicitly. Previous work combines separate GMM- and DFW-transformed spectral envelopes for each frame. This paper proposes a more effective DFW-based approach that (1) does not rely on the baseline GMM methods, and (2) functions on the acoustic class level. To adjust spectral power, an amplitude scaling function is used that compares the average target and warped source log spectra for each acoustic class. The proposed DFW with Amplitude scaling (DFWA) outperforms standard GMM and hybrid GMM-DFW methods for VC in terms of both speech quality and timbre conversion, as is confirmed in extensive objective and subjective testing. Furthermore, by not requiring time-alignment of source and target speech, DFWA is able to perform equally well using parallel or nonparallel corpora, as is demonstrated explicitly.",

Our idea is to explicitly exploit the unequal contribution of spatial regions to guide talking portrait modeling. Specifically, to improve the accuracy of dynamic head reconstruction, a compact and expressive NeRF-based Tri-Plane Hash Representation is introduced by pruning empty spatial regions with three planar hash encoders. For speech audio, we propose a Region Attention Module to generate region-aware condition feature via an attention mechanism. Different from existing methods that utilize an MLP-based encoder to learn the cross-modal relation implicitly, the attention mechanism builds an explicit connection between audio features and spatial regions to capture the priors of local motions. Moreover, a direct and fast Adaptive Pose Encoding is introduced to optimize the head-torso separation problem by mapping the complex transformation of the head pose into spatial coordinates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method renders better high-fidelity and audio-lips synchronized talking portrait videos, with realistic details and high efficiency compared to previous methods.",

We apply our method to various scenes with different types of controllable attributes (e.g. expression control on human faces, or state control in the movement of inanimate objects). Overall, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time novel view and novel attribute re-rendering of scenes from a single video.",

        "content1": "The objective of voice conversion system is to formulate the mapping function which can transform the source speaker characteristics to that of the target speaker. In this paper, we propose the General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) based model for voice conversion. It is a single pass learning network that makes the training procedure fast and comparatively less time consuming. The proposed system uses the shape of the vocal tract, the shape of the glottal pulse (excitation signal) and long term prosodic features to carry out the voice conversion task. In this paper, the shape of the vocal tract and the shape of source excitation of a particular speaker are represented using Line Spectral Frequencies (LSFs) and Linear Prediction (LP) residual respectively. GRNN is used to obtain the mapping function between the source and target speakers. The direct transformation of the time domain residual using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) causes phase change and generates artifacts in consecutive frames. In order to alleviate it, wavelet packet decomposed coefficients are used to characterize the excitation of the speech signal. The long term prosodic parameters namely, pitch contour (intonation) and the energy profile of the test signal are also modified in relation to that of the target (desired) speaker using the baseline method. The relative performances of the proposed model are compared to voice conversion system based on the state of the art RBF and GMM models using objective and subjective evaluation measures. The evaluation measures show that the proposed GRNN based voice conversion system performs slightly better than the state of the art models.",

Our neural dialogue system can directly interact with a structured database to assist users in accessing information and accomplishing certain tasks. The reinforcement learning based dialogue manager offers robust capabilities to handle noises caused by other components of the dialogue system. Our experiments in a movie-ticket booking domain show that our end-to-end system not only outperforms modularized dialogue system baselines for both objective and subjective evaluation, but also is robust to noises as demonstrated by several systematic experiments with different error granularity and rates specific to the language understanding module.",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on variational auto-encoding Wasserstein generative adversarial network (VAW-GAN), which makes use of a pre-trained speech emotion recognition (SER) model to transfer emotional style during training and at run-time inference. In this way, the network is able to transfer both seen and unseen emotional style to a new utterance.

        "content1": "A neural radiance field (NeRF) is a scene model supporting high-quality view synthesis, optimized per scene. In this paper, we explore enabling user editing of a category-level NeRF trained on a shape category. Specifically, we propose a method for propagating coarse 2D user scribbles to the 3D space, to modify the color or shape of a local region. First, we propose a conditional radiance field that incorporates new modular network components, including a branch that is shared across object instances in the category. Observing multiple instances of the same category, our model learns underlying part semantics without any supervision, thereby allowing the propagation of coarse 2D user scribbles to the entire 3D region (e.g., chair seat) in a consistent fashion. Next, we investigate for the editing tasks which components of our network require updating. We propose a hybrid network update strategy that targets the later network components, which balances efficiency and accuracy. During user interaction, we formulate an optimization problem that both satisfies the user's constraints and preserves the original object structure. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of editing tasks over three shape datasets and show that it outperforms prior neural editing approaches. Finally, we edit the appearance and shape of a real photograph and show that the edit propagates to extrapolated novel views.",

Unfortunately, existing methods such as DVR or IDR require accurate per-pixel object masks as supervision. At the same time, neural radiance fields have revolutionized novel view synthesis. However, NeRF's estimated volume density does not admit accurate surface reconstruction. Our key insight is that implicit surface models and radiance fields can be formulated in a unified way, enabling both surface and volume rendering using the same model. This unified perspective enables novel, more efficient sampling procedures and the ability to reconstruct accurate surfaces without input masks. We compare our method on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and a synthetic indoor dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that we outperform NeRF in terms of reconstruction quality while performing on par with IDR without requiring masks.",

Pixel-wise local alignment is learned in an unsupervised way via a deep network which optimizes photometric reconstruction errors. Frame-wise global alignment is performed using differentiable parameter estimation solvers on the pixel-wise correspondences to find a global transformation.

The field saw remarkable progress during the last few years, and existing event-based 3D reconstruction approaches recover sparse point clouds of the scene. However, such sparsity is a limiting factor in many cases, especially in computer vision and graphics, that has not been addressed satisfactorily so far. Accordingly, this paper proposes the first approach for 3D-consistent, dense and photorealistic novel view synthesis using just a single colour event stream as input. At its core is a neural radiance field trained entirely in a self-supervised manner from events while preserving the original resolution of the colour event channels. Next, our ray sampling strategy is tailored to events and allows for data-efficient training. At test, our method produces results in the RGB space at unprecedented quality. We evaluate our method qualitatively and numerically on several challenging synthetic and real scenes and show that it produces significantly denser and more visually appealing renderings than the existing methods. We also demonstrate robustness in challenging scenarios with fast motion and under low lighting conditions.

        "content1": "In Voice Conversion (VC), the speech of a source speaker is modified to resemble that of a particular target speaker. Currently, standard VC approaches use Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based transformations that do not generate high-quality converted speech due to “over-smoothing” resulting from weak links between individual source and target frame parameters. Dynamic Frequency Warping (DFW) offers an appealing alternative to GMM-based methods, as more spectral details are maintained in transformation; however, the speaker timbre is less successfully converted because spectral power is not adjusted explicitly. Previous work combines separate GMM- and DFW-transformed spectral envelopes for each frame. This paper proposes a more effective DFW-based approach that (1) does not rely on the baseline GMM methods, and (2) functions on the acoustic class level. To adjust spectral power, an amplitude scaling function is used that compares the average target and warped source log spectra for each acoustic class. The proposed DFW with Amplitude scaling (DFWA) outperforms standard GMM and hybrid GMM-DFW methods for VC in terms of both speech quality and timbre conversion, as is confirmed in extensive objective and subjective testing. Furthermore, by not requiring time-alignment of source and target speech, DFWA is able to perform equally well using parallel or nonparallel corpora, as is demonstrated explicitly.",

Our approach takes RGB images of a dynamic scene as input (e.g., from a monocular video recording), and creates a high-quality space-time geometry and appearance representation. We show that a single handheld consumer-grade camera is sufficient to synthesize sophisticated renderings of a dynamic scene from novel virtual camera views, e.g. a `bullet-time' video effect. NR-NeRF disentangles the dynamic scene into a canonical volume and its deformation. Scene deformation is implemented as ray bending, where straight rays are deformed non-rigidly. We also propose a novel rigidity network to better constrain rigid regions of the scene, leading to more stable results. The ray bending and rigidity network are trained without explicit supervision. Our formulation enables dense correspondence estimation across views and time, and compelling video editing applications such as motion exaggeration. Our code will be open sourced.",

Automatic metrics such as BLEU correlate weakly with human annotations, resulting in a significant bias across different models and datasets. Some researchers resort to human judgment experimentation for assessing response quality, which is expensive, time consuming, and not scalable. Moreover, judges tend to evaluate a small number of dialogues, meaning that minor differences in evaluation configuration may lead to dissimilar results. In this paper, we present interpretable metrics for evaluating topic coherence by making use of distributed sentence representations. Furthermore, we introduce calculable approximations of human judgment based on conversational coherence by adopting state-of-the-art entailment techniques. Results show that our metrics can be used as a surrogate for human judgment, making it easy to evaluate dialogue systems on large-scale datasets and allowing an unbiased estimate for the quality of the responses.",

In this work we study various model architectures and different ways to represent and aggregate the source information in an end-to-end neural dialogue system framework. A method called snapshot learning is also proposed to facilitate learning from supervised sequential signals by applying a companion cross-entropy objective function to the conditioning vector. The experimental and analytical results demonstrate firstly that competition occurs between the conditioning vector and the LM, and the differing architectures provide different trade-offs between the two.

We propose editable neural radiance fields that enable end-users to easily edit dynamic scenes and even support topological changes. Input with an image sequence from a single camera, our network is trained fully automatically and models topologically varying dynamics using our picked-out surface key points. Then end-users can edit the scene by easily dragging the key points to desired new positions. To achieve this, we propose a scene analysis method to detect and initialize key points by considering the dynamics in the scene, and a weighted key points strategy to model topologically varying dynamics by joint key points and weights optimization. Our method supports intuitive multi-dimensional (up to 3D) editing and can generate novel scenes that are unseen in the input sequence. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality editing on various dynamic scenes and outperforms the state-of-the-art.

        "content1": "The basic goal of the voice conversion system is to modify the speaker-specific characteristics, keeping the message and the environmental information contained in the speech signal intact. Speaker characteristics reflect in speech at different levels, such as, the shape of the glottal pulse (excitation source characteristics), the shape of the vocal tract (vocal tract system characteristics) and the long-term features (suprasegmental or prosodic characteristics). In this paper, we are proposing neural network models for developing mapping functions at each level. The features used for developing the mapping functions are extracted using pitch synchronous analysis. Pitch synchronous analysis provides the estimation of accurate vocal tract parameters, by analyzing the speech signal independently in each pitch period without influenced by the adjacent pitch cycles. In this work, the instants of significant excitation are used as pitch markers to perform the pitch synchronous analysis. The instants of significant excitation correspond to the instants of glottal closure (epochs) in the case of voiced speech, and to some random excitations like onset of burst in the case of nonvoiced speech. Instants of significant excitation are computed from the linear prediction (LP) residual of speech signals by using the property of average group-delay of minimum phase signals. In this paper, line spectral frequencies (LSFs) are used for representing the vocal tract characteristics, and for developing its associated mapping function. LP residual of the speech signal is viewed as excitation source, and the residual samples around the instant of glottal closure are used for mapping. Prosodic parameters at syllable and phrase levels are used for deriving the mapping function. Source and system level mapping functions are derived pitch synchronously, and the incorporation of target prosodic parameters is performed pitch synchronously using instants of significant excitation. The performance of the voice conversion system is evaluated using listening tests. The prediction accuracy of the mapping functions (neural network models) used at different levels in the proposed voice conversion system is further evaluated using objective measures such as deviation (\nD\ni\n)\n, root mean square error (\nμ\nRMSE\n) and correlation coefficient (\nγ\nX\n,\nY\n). The proposed approach (i.e., mapping and modification of parameters using pitch synchronous approach) used for voice conversion is shown to be performed better compared to the earlier method (mapping the vocal tract parameters using block processing) proposed by the author.",

        "content1": "Under good conditions, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown impressive results on novel view synthesis tasks. NeRFs learn a scene's color and density fields by minimizing the photometric discrepancy between training views and differentiable renderings of the scene. Once trained from a sufficient set of views, NeRFs can generate novel views from arbitrary camera positions. However, the scene geometry and color fields are severely under-constrained, which can lead to artifacts, especially when trained with few input views. To alleviate this problem we learn a prior over scene geometry and color, using a denoising diffusion model (DDM). Our DDM is trained on RGBD patches of the synthetic Hypersim dataset and can be used to predict the gradient of the logarithm of a joint probability distribution of color and depth patches. We show that, these gradients of logarithms of RGBD patch priors serve to regularize geometry and color of a scene. During NeRF training, random RGBD patches are rendered and the estimated gradient of the log-likelihood is backpropagated to the color and density fields. Evaluations on LLFF, the most relevant dataset, show that our learned prior achieves improved quality in the reconstructed geometry and improved generalization to novel views. Evaluations on DTU show improved reconstruction quality among NeRF methods.",

In this paper, we further improve its performance by utilizing the text transcriptions of parallel training data. First, a multi-task learning structure is designed which adds auxiliary classifiers to the middle layers of the seq2seq model and predicts linguistic labels as a secondary task. Second, a data-augmentation method is proposed which utilizes text alignment to produce extra parallel sequences for model training. Experiments are conducted to evaluate our proposed method with training sets at different sizes. Experimental results show that the multi-task learning with linguistic labels is effective at reducing the errors of seq2seq voice conversion. The data-augmentation method can further improve the performance of seq2seq voice conversion when only 50 or 100 training utterances are available.",

While NeRF works well on images of static subjects captured under controlled settings, it is incapable of modeling many ubiquitous, real-world phenomena in uncontrolled images, such as variable illumination or transient occluders. We introduce a series of extensions to NeRF to address these issues, thereby enabling accurate reconstructions from unstructured image collections taken from the internet.

One RTRBM is used for each speaker, with the goal of capturing high-order temporal dependencies in an acoustic sequence. Our algorithm starts from the separate training of one RTRBM for a source speaker and another for a target speaker using speaker-dependent training data. Because each RTRBM attempts to discover abstractions to maximally express the training data at each time step, as well as the temporal dependencies in the training data, we expect that the models represent the linguistic-related latent features in high-order spaces.

We introduce an ontology-based dialogue manage(OntoDM), a dialogue manager that keeps the state of the conversation, provides a basis for anaphora resolution and drives the conversation via domain ontologies. The banking and finance area promises great potential for disambiguating the context via a rich set of products and specificity of proper nouns, named entities and verbs. We used ontologies both as a knowledge base and a basis for the dialogue manager; the knowledge base component and dialogue manager components coalesce in a sense. Domain knowledge is used to track Entities of Interest, i.e. nodes (classes) of the ontology which happen to be products and services. In this way we also introduced conversation memory and attention in a sense. We finely blended linguistic methods, domain-driven keyword ranking and domain ontologies to create ways of domain-driven conversation. Proposed framework is used in our in-house German language banking and finance chatbots. General challenges of German language processing and finance-banking domain chatbot language models and lexicons are also introduced.

This is in large part due to the rapidly growing market demand for dialogue agents capable of goal-oriented behaviour. Due to the business process nature of these conversations, end-to-end machine learning systems are generally not a viable option, as the generated dialogue agents must be deployable and verifiable on behalf of the businesses authoring them.\n  In this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the creation of goal-oriented complex dialogue systems that dramatically eliminates the need for a designer to manually specify a dialogue tree, which nearly all current systems have to resort to when the interaction pattern falls outside standard patterns such as slot filling. We propose a declarative representation of the dialogue agent to be processed by state-of-the-art planning technology. Our proposed approach covers all aspects of the process; from model solicitation to the execution of the generated plans/dialogue agents. Along the way, we introduce novel planning encodings for declarative dialogue synthesis, a variety of interfaces for working with the specification as a dialogue architect, and a robust executor for generalized contingent plans.

        "content1": "Voice conversion methods based on frequency warping followed by amplitude scaling have been recently proposed. These methods modify the frequency axis of the source spectrum in such manner that some significant parts of it, usually the formants, are moved towards their image in the target speaker's spectrum. Amplitude scaling is then applied to compensate for the differences between warped source spectra and target spectra. This article presents a fully parametric formulation of a frequency warping plus amplitude scaling method in which bilinear frequency warping functions are used. Introducing this constraint allows for the conversion error to be described in the cepstral domain and to minimize it with respect to the parameters of the transformation through an iterative algorithm, even when multiple overlapping conversion classes are considered. The paper explores the advantages and limitations of this approach when applied to a cepstral representation of speech. We show that it achieves significant improvements in quality with respect to traditional methods based on Gaussian mixture models, with no loss in average conversion accuracy. Despite its relative simplicity, it achieves similar performance scores to state-of-the-art statistical methods involving dynamic features and global variance.",

In real-world applications, using explicit user feedback as the reward signal is often unreliable and costly to collect. This problem can be mitigated if the user's intent is known in advance or data is available to pre-train a task success predictor off-line. In practice neither of these apply for most real world applications. Here we propose an on-line learning framework whereby the dialogue policy is jointly trained alongside the reward model via active learning with a Gaussian process model. This Gaussian process operates on a continuous space dialogue representation generated in an unsupervised fashion using a recurrent neural network encoder-decoder. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to significantly reduce data annotation costs and mitigate noisy user feedback in dialogue policy learning.",

Using the HDR-NeRF, we are able to generate both novel HDR views and novel LDR views under different exposures. The key to our method is to model the physical imaging process, which dictates that the radiance of a scene point transforms to a pixel value in the LDR image with two implicit functions: a radiance field and a tone mapper. The radiance field encodes the scene radiance (values vary from 0 to +infty), which outputs the density and radiance of a ray by giving corresponding ray origin and ray direction. The tone mapper models the mapping process that a ray hitting on the camera sensor becomes a pixel value. The color of the ray is predicted by feeding the radiance and the corresponding exposure time into the tone mapper. We use the classic volume rendering technique to project the output radiance, colors, and densities into HDR and LDR images, while only the input LDR images are used as the supervision. We collect a new forward-facing HDR dataset to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world scenes validate that our method can not only accurately control the exposures of synthesized views but also render views with a high dynamic range.",

These priors are generated by correcting scale and shift parameters during training, with which we are then able to constrain the relative poses between consecutive frames. This constraint is achieved using our proposed novel loss functions. Experiments on real-world indoor and outdoor scenes show that our method can handle challenging camera trajectories and outperforms existing methods in terms of novel view rendering quality and pose estimation accuracy.

This paper presents a new voice conversion framework in which we combine frequency warping and exemplar-based method for voice conversion. Our method maintains high-resolution details during conversion by directly applying frequency warping on the high-resolution spectrum to represent the target. The warping function is generated by a sparse interpolation from a dictionary of exemplar warping functions. As the generated warping function is dependent only on a very small set of exemplars, we do away with the statistical averaging effects inherited from Gaussian mixture models. To compensate for the conversion error, we also apply residual exemplars into the conversion process.

In EVC, emotions are usually treated as discrete categories overlooking the fact that speech also conveys emotions with various intensity levels that the listener can perceive. In this paper, we aim to explicitly characterize and control the intensity of emotion. We propose to disentangle the speaker style from linguistic content and encode the speaker style into a style embedding in a continuous space that forms the prototype of emotion embedding. We further learn the actual emotion encoder from an emotion-labelled database and study the use of relative attributes to represent fine-grained emotion intensity. To ensure emotional intelligibility, we incorporate \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">emotion classification loss</i>\n and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">emotion embedding similarity loss</i>\n into the training of the EVC network.

We used ontologies both as a knowledge base and a basis for the dialogue manager; the knowledge base component and dialogue manager components coalesce in a sense. Domain knowledge is used to track Entities of Interest, i.e. nodes (classes) of the ontology which happen to be products and services. In this way we also introduced conversation memory and attention in a sense. We finely blended linguistic methods, domain-driven keyword ranking and domain ontologies to create ways of domain-driven conversation.

To better understand how humans make recommendations in communication, we design an annotation scheme related to recommendation strategies based on social science theories and annotate these dialogs. Our analysis shows that sociable recommendation strategies, such as sharing personal opinions or communicating with encouragement, more frequently lead to successful recommendations. Based on our dataset, we train end-to-end recommendation dialog systems with and without our strategy labels. In both automatic and human evaluation, our model with strategy incorporation outperforms the baseline model.

As a starting point, GUS was restricted to the role of a travel agent in a conversation with a client who wants to make a simple return trip to a single city in California.\nThere is good reason for restricting the domain of discourse for a computer system which is to engage in an English dialog. Specializing the subject matter that the system can talk about permits it to achieve some measure of realism without encompassing all the possibilities of human knowledge or of the English language. It also provides the user with specific motivation for participating in the conversation, thus narrowing the range of expectations that GUS must have about the user's purposes.

First, the recommended items cannot be always incorporated into the generated replies precisely and appropriately. Second, only the items mentioned in the training corpus have a chance to be recommended in the conversation. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel framework called NTRD for recommender dialogue system that decouples the dialogue generation from the item recommendation. NTRD has two key components, i.e., response template generator and item selector. The former adopts an encoder-decoder model to generate a response template with slot locations tied to target items, while the latter fills in slot locations with the proper items using a sufficient attention mechanism. Our approach combines the strengths of both classical slot filling approaches (that are generally controllable) and modern neural NLG approaches (that are generally more natural and accurate). Extensive experiments on the benchmark ReDial show our NTRD significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods. Besides, our approach has the unique advantage to produce novel items that do not appear in the training set of dialogue corpus. The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/jokieleung/NTRD}.",

        "content1": "Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have demonstrated the potential of coordinate-based neural representation (neural fields or implicit neural representation) in neural rendering. However, using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to represent a 3D scene or object requires enormous computational resources and time. There have been recent studies on how to reduce these computational inefficiencies by using additional data structures, such as grids or trees. Despite the promising performance, the explicit data structure necessitates a substantial amount of memory. In this work, we present a method to reduce the size without compromising the advantages of having additional data structures. In detail, we propose using the wavelet transform on grid-based neural fields. Grid-based neural fields are for fast convergence, and the wavelet transform, whose efficiency has been demonstrated in high-performance standard codecs, is to improve the parameter efficiency of grids. Furthermore, in order to achieve a higher sparsity of grid coefficients while maintaining reconstruction quality, we present a novel trainable masking approach. Experimental results demonstrate that non-spatial grid coefficients, such as wavelet coefficients, are capable of attaining a higher level of sparsity than spatial grid coefficients, resulting in a more compact representation. With our proposed mask and compression pipeline, we achieved state-of-the-art performance within a memory budget of 2 MB. Our code is available at https://github.com/daniel03c1/masked_wavelet_nerf.",

        "content1": "Voice conversion, as considered in this paper, is defined as modifying the speech signal of one speaker (source speaker) so that it sounds as if it had been pronounced by a different speaker (target speaker). Our contribution includes the design of a new methodology for representing the relationship between two sets of spectral envelopes. The proposed method is based on the use of a Gaussian mixture model of the source speaker spectral envelopes. The conversion itself is represented by a continuous parametric function which takes into account the probabilistic classification provided by the mixture model. The parameters of the conversion function are estimated by least squares optimization on the training data. This conversion method is implemented in the context of the HNM (harmonic+noise model) system, which allows high-quality modifications of speech signals. Compared to earlier methods based on vector quantization, the proposed conversion scheme results in a much better match between the converted envelopes and the target envelopes. Evaluation by objective tests and formal listening tests shows that the proposed transform greatly improves the quality and naturalness of the converted speech signals compared with previous proposed conversion methods.",

We propose a framework to remove objects from a NeRF representation created from an RGB-D sequence. Our NeRF inpainting method leverages recent work in 2D image inpainting and is guided by a user-provided mask. Our algorithm is underpinned by a confidence based view selection procedure. It chooses which of the individual 2D inpainted images to use in the creation of the NeRF, so that the resulting inpainted NeRF is 3D consistent.

Input with an image sequence from a single camera, our network is trained fully automatically and models topologically varying dynamics using our picked-out surface key points. Then end-users can edit the scene by easily dragging the key points to desired new positions. To achieve this, we propose a scene analysis method to detect and initialize key points by considering the dynamics in the scene, and a weighted key points strategy to model topologically varying dynamics by joint key points and weights optimization.

We collected a large dataset with 1,017 dialogues and annotated emerging persuasion strategies from a subset. Based on the annotation, we built a baseline classifier with context information and sentence-level features to predict the 10 persuasion strategies used in the corpus.

Seq2Seq has been outstanding at numerous tasks involving sequence modeling such as speech synthesis and recognition, machine translation, and image captioning. In contrast to current VC techniques, our method 1) stabilizes and accelerates the training procedure by considering guided attention and proposed context preservation losses, 2) allows not only spectral envelopes but also fundamental frequency contours and durations of speech to be converted, 3) requires no context information such as phoneme labels, and 4) requires no time-aligned source and target speech data in advance. In our experiment, the proposed VC framework can be trained in only one day, using only one GPU of an NVIDIA Tesla K80, while the quality of the synthesized speech is higher than that of speech converted by Gaussian mixture model-based VC and is comparable to that of speech generated by recurrent neural network-based text-to-speech synthesis, which can be regarded as an upper limit on VC performance.",

We conduct listening tests based on speaker discrimination of same/difference pairs to measure the accuracy by which the converted voices match the desired target voices. To establish the level of human performance as a baseline, we first measure the ability of listeners to discriminate between original speech utterances under three conditions: normal, fundamental frequency and duration normalized, and LPC coded. Additionally, the spectral parameter conversion function is tested in isolation by listening to source, target, and converted speakers as LPC coded speech. The results show that the speaker identity of speech whose LPC spectrum has been converted can be recognized as the target speaker with the same level of performance as discriminating between LPC coded speech. However, the level of discrimination of converted utterances produced by the full VC system is significantly below that of speaker discrimination of natural speech.",

Yet, generating these images is very computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a technique based on spatial decomposition capable of mitigating this issue. Our key observation is that there are diminishing returns in employing larger (deeper and/or wider) networks. Hence, we propose to spatially decompose a scene and dedicate smaller networks for each decomposed part. When working together, these networks can render the whole scene. This allows us near-constant inference time regardless of the number of decomposed parts. Moreover, we show that a Voronoi spatial decomposition is preferable for this purpose, as it is provably compatible with the Painter's Algorithm for efficient and GPU-friendly rendering. Our experiments show that for real-world scenes, our method provides up to 3x more efficient inference than NeRF (with the same rendering quality), or an improvement of up to 1.0 dB in PSNR (for the same inference cost).",

To facilitate research in this area, we have carried out a wide survey of publicly available datasets suitable for data-driven learning of dialogue systems.

        "content1": "This paper describes the experimental setups and the evaluation results of the sixth Dialog System Technology Challenges (DSTC6) aiming to develop end-to-end dialogue systems. Neural network models have become a recent focus of investigation in dialogue technologies. Previous models required training data to be manually annotated with word meanings and dialogue states, but end-to-end neural network dialogue systems learn to directly output natural-language system responses without needing training data to be manually annotated. Thus, this approach allows us to scale up the size of training data and cover more dialog domains. In addition, dialogue systems require a meta-function to avoid deploying inappropriate responses generated by themselves. To challenge such issues, the DSTC6 consists of three tracks, (1). End-to-End Goal Oriented dialogue Learning to select system responses, (2). End-to-End Conversation Modeling to generate system responses using Natural Language Generation (NLG) and (3). Dialogue Breakdown Detection. Since each domain has different issues to be addressed to develop dialogue systems, we targeted restaurant retrieval dialogues to fill slot-value in Track 1, customer services on Twitter by combining goal-oriented dialogues and ChitChat in Track 2 and human-machine dialogue data for ChitChat in Track 3.\nDSTC6 had 141 people declaring their interests and 23 teams submitted their final results. 18 scientific papers were presented in the wrap-up workshop. We find the blending end-to-end trainable models associated to meaningful prior knowledge performs the best for the restaurant retrieval for Track 1. Indeed, Hybrid Code Network and Memory Network have been the best models for this task. In Track 2, 78.5% of the system responses automatically generated by the best system were rated better than acceptable by humans and this achieves 89% of the number of the human responses rated in the same class. In Track3, the dialogue breakdown detection technologies performed as well as human agreements, in both data-sets of English and Japanese.",

        "content1": "Open-domain human-computer conversation has attracted much attention in the field of NLP. Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information. The generated reply is then fed back as a new candidate for post-reranking. Experimental results show that such ensemble outperforms each single part of it by a large margin.",

This is in large part due to the rapidly growing market demand for dialogue agents capable of goal-oriented behaviour. Due to the business process nature of these conversations, end-to-end machine learning systems are generally not a viable option, as the generated dialogue agents must be deployable and verifiable on behalf of the businesses authoring them.\n  In this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the creation of goal-oriented complex dialogue systems that dramatically eliminates the need for a designer to manually specify a dialogue tree, which nearly all current systems have to resort to when the interaction pattern falls outside standard patterns such as slot filling. We propose a declarative representation of the dialogue agent to be processed by state-of-the-art planning technology. Our proposed approach covers all aspects of the process; from model solicitation to the execution of the generated plans/dialogue agents. Along the way, we introduce novel planning encodings for declarative dialogue synthesis, a variety of interfaces for working with the specification as a dialogue architect, and a robust executor for generalized contingent plans. We have created prototype implementations of all components, and in this paper, we further demonstrate the resulting system empirically.",

However, it remains underexplored how the appearance of such representations can be efficiently edited while maintaining photorealism. In this work, we present PaletteNeRF, a novel method for photorealistic appearance editing of neural radiance fields (NeRF) based on 3D color decomposition. Our method decomposes the appearance of each 3D point into a linear combination of palette-based bases (i.e., 3D segmentations defined by a group of NeRF-type functions) that are shared across the scene. While our palette-based bases are view-independent, we also predict a view-dependent function to capture the color residual (e.g., specular shading). During training, we jointly optimize the basis functions and the color palettes, and we also introduce novel regularizers to encourage the spatial coherence of the decomposition. Our method allows users to efficiently edit the appearance of the 3D scene by modifying the color palettes. We also extend our framework with compressed semantic features for semantic-aware appearance editing. We demonstrate that our technique is superior to baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively for appearance editing of complex real-world scenes.",

Especially, for telepresence applications in AR or VR, a faithful reproduction of the appearance including novel viewpoint or head-poses is required. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches that model the geometry and material properties explicitly, or are purely image-based, we introduce an implicit representation of the head based on scene representation networks. To handle the dynamics of the face, we combine our scene representation network with a low-dimensional morphable model which provides explicit control over pose and expressions. We use volumetric rendering to generate images from this hybrid representation and demonstrate that such a dynamic neural scene representation can be learned from monocular input data only, without the need of a specialized capture setup. In our experiments, we show that this learned volumetric representation allows for photorealistic image generation that surpasses the quality of state-of-the-art video-based reenactment methods.",

Real-world human conversation, in contrast, involves other modalities, such as voice, facial expression and body language, which can influence the conversation significantly in certain scenarios. In this work, we explore the impact of incorporating the audio features of the user message into generative dialogue systems. Specifically, we first design an auxiliary response retrieval task for audio representation learning. Then, we use word-level modality fusion to incorporate the audio features as additional context to our main generative model.

We address this limitation by introducing Ref-NeRF, which replaces NeRF's parameterization of view-dependent outgoing radiance with a representation of reflected radiance and structures this function using a collection of spatially-varying scene properties. We show that together with a regularizer on normal vectors, our model significantly improves the realism and accuracy of specular reflections. Furthermore, we show that our model's internal representation of outgoing radiance is interpretable and useful for scene editing.",

We first develop a multi-speaker speech synthesis system with sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder extracts the linguistic representations of input text, while the decoder, conditioned on target speaker embedding, takes the context vectors and the attention recurrent network cell output to generate target acoustic features. We take advantage of the fact that TTS system maps input text to speaker independent context vectors, thus re-purpose such a mapping to supervise the training of the latent representations of an encoder-decoder voice conversion system. In the voice conversion system, the encoder takes speech instead of text as the input, while the decoder is functionally similar to the TTS decoder. As we condition the decoder on a speaker embedding, the system can be trained on non-parallel data for any-to-any voice conversion. During voice conversion training, we present both text and speech to speech synthesis and voice conversion networks respectively. At run-time, the voice conversion network uses its own encoder-decoder architecture without the need of text input. Experiments show that the proposed TTL-VC system outperforms two competitive voice conversion baselines consistently, namely phonetic posteriorgram and AutoVC methods, in terms of speech quality, naturalness, and speaker similarity.",

Most NLG systems in common use employ rules and heuristics and tend to generate rigid and stylised responses without the natural variation of human language. They are also not easily scaled to systems covering multiple domains and languages. This paper presents a statistical language generator based on a semantically controlled Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) structure. The LSTM generator can learn from unaligned data by jointly optimising sentence planning and surface realisation using a simple cross entropy training criterion, and language variation can be easily achieved by sampling from output candidates. With fewer heuristics, an objective evaluation in two differing test domains showed the proposed method improved performance compared to previous methods. Human judges scored the LSTM system higher on informativeness and naturalness and overall preferred it to the other systems.",

        "content1": "Open-domain human-computer conversation has attracted much attention in the field of NLP. Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information. The generated reply is then fed back as a new candidate for post-reranking. Experimental results show that such ensemble outperforms each single part of it by a large margin.",

        "content1": "Generating complex multi-turn goal-oriented dialogue agents is a difficult problem that has seen a considerable focus from many leaders in the tech industry, including IBM, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. This is in large part due to the rapidly growing market demand for dialogue agents capable of goal-oriented behaviour. Due to the business process nature of these conversations, end-to-end machine learning systems are generally not a viable option, as the generated dialogue agents must be deployable and verifiable on behalf of the businesses authoring them.\n  In this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the creation of goal-oriented complex dialogue systems that dramatically eliminates the need for a designer to manually specify a dialogue tree, which nearly all current systems have to resort to when the interaction pattern falls outside standard patterns such as slot filling. We propose a declarative representation of the dialogue agent to be processed by state-of-the-art planning technology. Our proposed approach covers all aspects of the process; from model solicitation to the execution of the generated plans/dialogue agents. Along the way, we introduce novel planning encodings for declarative dialogue synthesis, a variety of interfaces for working with the specification as a dialogue architect, and a robust executor for generalized contingent plans. We have created prototype implementations of all components, and in this paper, we further demonstrate the resulting system empirically.",

Our approach extends neural radiance fields (NeRF) to the dynamic scenes with human movements via introducing explicit pose-guided deformation while learning the scene representation network. In particular, we estimate the human pose for each frame and learn a constant canonical space for the detailed human template, which enables natural shape deformation from the observation space to the canonical space under the explicit control of the pose parameters. To compensate for inaccurate pose estimation, we introduce the pose refinement strategy that updates the initial pose during the learning process, which not only helps to learn more accurate human reconstruction but also accelerates the convergence. In experiments we show that the proposed approach achieves 1) implicit human geometry and appearance reconstruction with high-quality details, 2) photo-realistic rendering of the human from novel views, and 3) animation of the human with novel poses.",

However, current approaches to NeRF-based models rely on clean images with accurate camera calibration, which can be difficult to obtain in the real world, where data is often subject to corruption and distortion. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the robustness of NeRF-based novel view synthesis algorithms in the presence of different types of corruptions.\n  We find that NeRF-based models are significantly degraded in the presence of corruption, and are more sensitive to a different set of corruptions than image recognition models. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of the feature encoder in generalizable methods, which synthesize images using neural features extracted via convolutional neural networks or transformers, and find that it only contributes marginally to robustness. Finally, we reveal that standard data augmentation techniques, which can significantly improve the robustness of recognition models, do not help the robustness of NeRF-based models. We hope that our findings will attract more researchers to study the robustness of NeRF-based approaches and help to improve their performance in the real world.",

In contrast to all previous NeRF methods, DIVeR uses deterministic rather than stochastic estimates of the volume rendering integral. DIVeR's representation is a voxel based field of features. To compute the volume rendering integral, a ray is broken into intervals, one per voxel; components of the volume rendering integral are estimated from the features for each interval using an MLP, and the components are aggregated. As a result, DIVeR can render thin translucent structures that are missed by other integrators. Furthermore, DIVeR's representation has semantics that is relatively exposed compared to other such methods -- moving feature vectors around in the voxel space results in natural edits. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons to current state-of-the-art methods show that DIVeR produces models that (1) render at or above state-of-the-art quality, (2) are very small without being baked, (3) render very fast without being baked, and (4) can be edited in natural ways.",

In our setting, each individual MLP only needs to represent parts of the scene, thus smaller and faster-to-evaluate MLPs can be used. By combining this divide-and-conquer strategy with further optimizations, rendering is accelerated by three orders of magnitude compared to the original NeRF model without incurring high storage costs.

        "content1": "Recent work on radiance fields and volumetric inverse rendering (e.g., NeRFs) has provided excellent results in building data-driven models of real scenes for novel view synthesis with high photorealism. While full control over viewpoint is achieved, scene lighting is typically \"baked\" into the model and cannot be changed; other methods only capture limited variation in lighting or make restrictive assumptions about the captured scene. These limitations prevent the application on arbitrary materials and novel 3D environments with complex, distinct lighting. In this paper, we target the application scenario of capturing high-fidelity assets for neural relighting in controlled studio conditions, but without requiring a dense light stage. Instead, we leverage a small number of area lights commonly used in photogrammetry. We propose ReNeRF, a relightable radiance field model based on the intuitive and powerful approach of image-based relighting, which implicitly captures global light transport (for arbitrary objects) without complex, error-prone simulations. Thus, our new method is simple and provides full control over viewpoint and lighting, without simplistic assumptions about how light interacts with the scene. In addition, ReNeRF does not rely on the usual assumption of distant lighting - during training, we explicitly account for the distance between 3D points in the volume and point samples on the light sources. Thus, at test time, we achieve better generalization to novel, continuous lighting directions, including nearfield lighting effects.",

        "content1": "This paper proposes an any-to-many location-relative, sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq), non-parallel voice conversion approach, which utilizes text supervision during training. In this approach, we combine a bottle-neck feature extractor (BNE) with a seq2seq synthesis module. During the training stage, an encoder-decoder-based hybrid connectionist-temporal-classification-attention (CTC-attention) phoneme recognizer is trained, whose encoder has a bottle-neck layer. A BNE is obtained from the phoneme recognizer and is utilized to extract speaker-independent, dense and rich spoken content representations from spectral features. Then a multi-speaker location-relative attention based seq2seq synthesis model is trained to reconstruct spectral features from the bottle-neck features, conditioning on speaker representations for speaker identity control in the generated speech. To mitigate the difficulties of using seq2seq models to align long sequences, we down-sample the input spectral feature along the temporal dimension and equip the synthesis model with a discretized mixture of logistic (MoL) attention mechanism. Since the phoneme recognizer is trained with large speech recognition data corpus, the proposed approach can conduct any-to-many voice conversion. Objective and subjective evaluations show that the proposed any-to-many approach has superior voice conversion performance in terms of both naturalness and speaker similarity. Ablation studies are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of feature selection and model design strategies in the proposed approach. The proposed VC approach can readily be extended to support any-to-any VC (also known as one/few-shot VC), and achieve high performance according to objective and subjective evaluations.",

The standard approach to constructing neural radiance fields takes advantage of multi-view consistency and requires many calibrated views of a scene, a requirement that cannot be satisfied when learning on large-scale image data in the wild. We take a step towards addressing this shortcoming by introducing a model that encodes the input image into a disentangled object representation that contains a code for object shape, a code for object appearance, and an estimated camera pose from which the object image is captured. Our model conditions a NeRF on the predicted object representation and uses volume rendering to generate images from novel views. We train the model end-to-end on a large collection of input images. As the model is only provided with single-view images, the problem is highly under-constrained. Therefore, in addition to using a reconstruction loss on the synthesized input view, we use an auxiliary adversarial loss on the novel rendered views. Furthermore, we leverage object symmetry and cycle camera pose consistency. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on the ShapeNet dataset as well as qualitative experiments on Open Images dataset.

Nonetheless, without sufficient data, seq2seq VC models can suffer from unstable training and mispronunciation problems in the converted speech, thus far from practical. To tackle these shortcomings, we propose to transfer knowledge from other speech processing tasks where large-scale corpora are easily available, typically text-to-speech (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR). We argue that VC models initialized with such pretrained ASR or TTS model parameters can generate effective hidden representations for high-fidelity, highly intelligible converted speech. In this work, we examine our proposed method in a parallel, one-to-one setting. We employed recurrent neural network (RNN)-based and Transformer based models, and through systematical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the pretraining scheme and the superiority of Transformer based models over RNN-based models in terms of intelligibility, naturalness, and similarity.",

        "content1": "In a spoken dialog system, determining which action a machine should take in a given situation is a difficult problem because automatic speech recognition is unreliable and hence the state of the conversation can never be known with certainty. Much of the research in spoken dialog systems centres on mitigating this uncertainty and recent work has focussed on three largely disparate techniques: parallel dialog state hypotheses, local use of confidence scores, and automated planning. While in isolation each of these approaches can improve action selection, taken together they currently lack a unified statistical framework that admits global optimization. In this paper we cast a spoken dialog system as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We show how this formulation unifies and extends existing techniques to form a single principled framework. A number of illustrations are used to show qualitatively the potential benefits of POMDPs compared to existing techniques, and empirical results from dialog simulations are presented which demonstrate significant quantitative gains. Finally, some of the key challenges to advancing this method – in particular scalability – are briefly outlined.",

Previous works wildly utilize the disentangle-based models. The disentangle-based model assumes the speech consists of content and speaker style information and aims to untangle them to change the style information for conversion. Previous works focus on reducing the dimension of speech to get the content information. But the size is hard to determine to lead to the untangle overlapping problem. We propose the Disentangled Representation Voice Conversion (DRVC) model to address the issue. DRVC model is an end-to-end self-supervised model consisting of the content encoder, timbre encoder, and generator. Instead of the previous work for reducing speech size to get content, we propose a cycle for restricting the disentanglement by the Cycle Reconstruct Loss and Same Loss. The experiments show there is an improvement for converted speech on quality and voice similarity.",

In this paper, instead of exploiting few-shot image synthesis, we study the novel view extrapolation setting that (1) the training images can well describe an object, and (2) there is a notable discrepancy between the training and test viewpoints' distributions. We present RapNeRF (RAy Priors) as a solution. Our insight is that the inherent appearances of a 3D surface's arbitrary visible projections should be consistent. We thus propose a random ray casting policy that allows training unseen views using seen views. Furthermore, we show that a ray atlas pre-computed from the observed rays' viewing directions could further enhance the rendering quality for extrapolated views. A main limitation is that RapNeRF would remove the strong view-dependent effects because it leverages the multi-view consistency property.",

        "content1": "The objective of voice conversion system is to formulate the mapping function which can transform the source speaker characteristics to that of the target speaker. In this paper, we propose the General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) based model for voice conversion. It is a single pass learning network that makes the training procedure fast and comparatively less time consuming. The proposed system uses the shape of the vocal tract, the shape of the glottal pulse (excitation signal) and long term prosodic features to carry out the voice conversion task. In this paper, the shape of the vocal tract and the shape of source excitation of a particular speaker are represented using Line Spectral Frequencies (LSFs) and Linear Prediction (LP) residual respectively. GRNN is used to obtain the mapping function between the source and target speakers. The direct transformation of the time domain residual using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) causes phase change and generates artifacts in consecutive frames. In order to alleviate it, wavelet packet decomposed coefficients are used to characterize the excitation of the speech signal. The long term prosodic parameters namely, pitch contour (intonation) and the energy profile of the test signal are also modified in relation to that of the target (desired) speaker using the baseline method. The relative performances of the proposed model are compared to voice conversion system based on the state of the art RBF and GMM models using objective and subjective evaluation measures. The evaluation measures show that the proposed GRNN based voice conversion system performs slightly better than the state of the art models.",

In addition, we introduce a new dialogue multi-task pre-training strategy that allows the model to learn the primary TOD task completion skills from heterogeneous dialog corpora. We extensively test our model on three benchmark TOD tasks, including end-to-end dialogue modelling, dialogue state tracking, and intent classification. Experimental results show that PPTOD achieves new state of the art on all evaluated tasks in both high-resource and low-resource scenarios. Furthermore, comparisons against previous SOTA methods show that the responses generated by PPTOD are more factually correct and semantically coherent as judged by human annotators.",
        "content2": "Task-oriented dialogue systems are either modularized with separate dialogue state tracking (DST) and management steps or end-to-end trainable.

Modularized systems rely on DST to interact with the KB, which is expensive in terms of annotation and inference time. End-to-end systems use the KB directly as input, but they cannot scale when the KB is larger than a few hundred entries. In this paper, we propose a method to embed the KB, of any size, directly into the model parameters. The resulting model does not require any DST or template responses, nor the KB as input, and it can dynamically update its KB via fine-tuning. We evaluate our solution in five task-oriented dialogue datasets with small, medium, and large KB size. Our experiments show that end-to-end models can effectively embed knowledge bases in their parameters and achieve competitive performance in all evaluated datasets.",

However, while established techniques exist for embedding ownership or copyright information within conventional visual data such as images and videos, the challenges posed by the emerging NeRF format have remained unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce StegaNeRF, an innovative approach for steganographic information embedding within NeRF renderings. We have meticulously developed an optimization framework that enables precise retrieval of hidden information from images generated by NeRF, while ensuring the original visual quality of the rendered images to remain intact. Through rigorous experimentation, we assess the efficacy of our methodology across various potential deployment scenarios. Furthermore, we delve into the insights gleaned from our analysis.

        "content2": " Recent progress on multi-view 3D object reconstruction has featured neural implicit surfaces via learning high-fidelity radiance fields.However, most approaches hinge on the visual hull derived from cost-expensive silhouette masks to obtain object surfaces.In this paper, we propose a novel Object-aware Radiance Fields (ORF) to automatically learn an object-aware geometry reconstruction.the geometric correspondences between multi-view 2d object regions and 3d implicitexplicit object surfaces are additionally exploited to boost the learning of object surfacesTechnically, a critical transparency discriminator is designed to distinguish the object-intersected and object-bypassed rays based on the estimated 2D object regions, leading to 3D implicit object surfaces.such implicit surfaces can be directly converted via moving cubes into explicit object surfaces eg meshesthen we build the geometric correspondence between 2d planes and 3d meshes by rasterization and project the estimated object regions into 3d explicit object surfaces by aggregating the object information across multiple viewsThe aggregated object information in 3D explicit object surfaces is further reprojected back to 2D planes, aiming to update 2D object regions and enforce them to be multi-view consistent.extensive experiments on dtu and blendedmvs verify the capability of orf to produce comparable surfaces against the state-of-the-art models that demand silhouette masks",

MinTL is a simple yet effective transfer learning framework, which allows us to plug-and-play pre-trained seq2seq models, and jointly learn dialogue state tracking and dialogue response generation. Unlike previous approaches, which use a copy mechanism to \"carryover\" the old dialogue states to the new one, we introduce Levenshtein belief spans (Lev), that allows efficient dialogue state tracking with a minimal generation length. We instantiate our learning framework with two pre-trained backbones: T5 and BART, and evaluate them on MultiWOZ. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: 1) our systems establish new state-of-the-art results on end-to-end response generation, 2) MinTL-based systems are more robust than baseline methods in the low resource setting, and they achieve competitive results with only 20\\% training data, and 3) Lev greatly improves the inference efficiency.",

        "content1": "Differences in speaker characteristics, recording conditions, and signal processing algorithms affect output quality in voice conversion systems. This study focuses on formulating robust techniques for a codebook mapping based voice conversion algorithm. Three different methods are used to improve voice conversion performance: confidence measures, pre-emphasis, and spectral equalization. Analysis is performed for each method and the implementation details are discussed. The first method employs confidence measures in the training stage to eliminate problematic pairs of source and target speech units that might result from possible misalignments, speaking style differences or pronunciation variations. Four confidence measures are developed based on the spectral distance, fundamental frequency (f0) distance, energy distance, and duration distance between the source and target speech units. The second method focuses on the importance of pre-emphasis in line-spectral frequency (LSF) based vocal tract modeling and transformation. The last method, spectral equalization, is aimed at reducing the differences in the source and target long-term spectra when the source and target recording conditions are significantly different. The voice conversion algorithm that employs the proposed techniques is compared with the baseline voice conversion algorithm with objective tests as well as three subjective listening tests. First, similarity to the target voice is evaluated in a subjective listening test and it is shown that the proposed algorithm improves similarity to the target voice by 23.0%. An ABX test is performed and the proposed algorithm is preferred over the baseline algorithm by 76.4%. In the third test, the two algorithms are compared in terms of the subjective quality of the voice conversion output. The proposed algorithm improves the subjective output quality by 46.8% in terms of mean opinion score (MOS).",

        "content1": "This paper describes the experimental setups and the evaluation results of the sixth Dialog System Technology Challenges (DSTC6) aiming to develop end-to-end dialogue systems. Neural network models have become a recent focus of investigation in dialogue technologies. Previous models required training data to be manually annotated with word meanings and dialogue states, but end-to-end neural network dialogue systems learn to directly output natural-language system responses without needing training data to be manually annotated. Thus, this approach allows us to scale up the size of training data and cover more dialog domains. In addition, dialogue systems require a meta-function to avoid deploying inappropriate responses generated by themselves. To challenge such issues, the DSTC6 consists of three tracks, (1). End-to-End Goal Oriented dialogue Learning to select system responses, (2). End-to-End Conversation Modeling to generate system responses using Natural Language Generation (NLG) and (3). Dialogue Breakdown Detection. Since each domain has different issues to be addressed to develop dialogue systems, we targeted restaurant retrieval dialogues to fill slot-value in Track 1, customer services on Twitter by combining goal-oriented dialogues and ChitChat in Track 2 and human-machine dialogue data for ChitChat in Track 3.\nDSTC6 had 141 people declaring their interests and 23 teams submitted their final results. 18 scientific papers were presented in the wrap-up workshop. We find the blending end-to-end trainable models associated to meaningful prior knowledge performs the best for the restaurant retrieval for Track 1. Indeed, Hybrid Code Network and Memory Network have been the best models for this task. In Track 2, 78.5% of the system responses automatically generated by the best system were rated better than acceptable by humans and this achieves 89% of the number of the human responses rated in the same class. In Track3, the dialogue breakdown detection technologies performed as well as human agreements, in both data-sets of English and Japanese.",

DeBi-HMM is named for its duration-embedded characteristic of the two HMMs for modeling the source and target speech signals, respectively. Joint estimation of source and target HMMs is exploited for spectrum conversion from neutral to expressive speech. Gamma distribution is embedded as the duration model for each state in source and target HMMs. The expressive style-dependent decision trees achieve prosodic conversion. The STRAIGHT algorithm is adopted for the analysis and synthesis process. A set of small-sized speech databases for each expressive style is designed and collected to train the DeBi-HMM voice conversion models. Several experiments with statistical hypothesis testing are conducted to evaluate the quality of synthetic speech as perceived by human subjects. Compared with previous voice conversion methods, the proposed method exhibits encouraging potential in expressive speech synthesis.",

The energy profile of the signal is modified using a fixed scaling factor defined between the source and target speakers at the segmental level. Two different methods for residual modification such as residual copying and residual selection methods are used to generate the target residual signal. The performance of ANN and GMM based voice conversion (VC) system are conducted using subjective and objective measures.

        "content1": "In this paper, we address the challenging problem of 3D toonification, which involves transferring the style of an artistic domain onto a target 3D face with stylized geometry and texture. Although fine-tuning a pre-trained 3D GAN on the artistic domain can produce reasonable performance, this strategy has limitations in the 3D domain. In particular, fine-tuning can deteriorate the original GAN latent space, which affects subsequent semantic editing, and requires independent optimization and storage for each new style, limiting flexibility and efficient deployment. To overcome these challenges, we propose DeformToon3D, an effective toonification framework tailored for hierarchical 3D GAN. Our approach decomposes 3D toonification into subproblems of geometry and texture stylization to better preserve the original latent space. Specifically, we devise a novel StyleField that predicts conditional 3D deformation to align a real-space NeRF to the style space for geometry stylization. Thanks to the StyleField formulation, which already handles geometry stylization well, texture stylization can be achieved conveniently via adaptive style mixing that injects information of the artistic domain into the decoder of the pre-trained 3D GAN. Due to the unique design, our method enables flexible style degree control and shape-texture-specific style swap. Furthermore, we achieve efficient training without any real-world 2D-3D training pairs but proxy samples synthesized from off-the-shelf 2D toonification models.",

        "content1": "In Voice Conversion (VC), the speech of a source speaker is modified to resemble that of a particular target speaker. Currently, standard VC approaches use Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based transformations that do not generate high-quality converted speech due to “over-smoothing” resulting from weak links between individual source and target frame parameters. Dynamic Frequency Warping (DFW) offers an appealing alternative to GMM-based methods, as more spectral details are maintained in transformation; however, the speaker timbre is less successfully converted because spectral power is not adjusted explicitly. Previous work combines separate GMM- and DFW-transformed spectral envelopes for each frame. This paper proposes a more effective DFW-based approach that (1) does not rely on the baseline GMM methods, and (2) functions on the acoustic class level. To adjust spectral power, an amplitude scaling function is used that compares the average target and warped source log spectra for each acoustic class. The proposed DFW with Amplitude scaling (DFWA) outperforms standard GMM and hybrid GMM-DFW methods for VC in terms of both speech quality and timbre conversion, as is confirmed in extensive objective and subjective testing. Furthermore, by not requiring time-alignment of source and target speech, DFWA is able to perform equally well using parallel or nonparallel corpora, as is demonstrated explicitly.",

        "content1": "An electrolarynx (EL) is a medical device that generates sound source signals to provide laryngectomees with a voice. In this article we focus on two problems of speech produced with an EL (EL speech). One problem is that EL speech is extremely unnatural and the other is that sound source signals with high energy are generated by an EL, and therefore, the signals often annoy surrounding people. To address these two problems, in this article we propose three speaking-aid systems that enhance three different types of EL speech signals: EL speech, EL speech using an air-pressure sensor (EL-air speech), and silent EL speech. The air-pressure sensor enables a laryngectomee to manipulate the F0 contours of EL speech using exhaled air that flows from the tracheostoma. Silent EL speech is produced with a new sound source unit that generates signals with extremely low energy. Our speaking-aid systems address the poor quality of EL speech using voice conversion (VC), which transforms acoustic features so that it appears as if the speech is uttered by another person. Our systems estimate spectral parameters, F0, and aperiodic components independently. The result of experimental evaluations demonstrates that the use of an air-pressure sensor dramatically improves F0 estimation accuracy. Moreover, it is revealed that the converted speech signals are preferred to source EL speech.",
        "content2": "The objective of voice conversion algorithms is to modify the speech by a particular source speaker so that it sounds as if spoken by a different target speaker. Current conversion algorithms employ a training procedure, during which the same utterances spoken by both the source and target speakers are needed for deriving the desired conversion parameters. Such a (parallel) corpus, is often difficult or impossible to collect. Here, we propose an algorithm that relaxes this constraint, i.e., the training corpus does not necessarily contain the same utterances from both speakers. The proposed algorithm is based on speaker adaptation techniques, adapting the conversion parameters derived for a particular pair of speakers to a different pair, for which only a nonparallel corpus is available. We show that adaptation reduces the error obtained when simply applying the conversion parameters of one pair of speakers to another by a factor that can reach 30%. A speaker identification measure is also employed that more insightfully portrays the importance of adaptation, while listening tests confirm the success of our method. Both the objective and subjective tests employed, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable results with the ideal case when a parallel corpus is available.",

Our solution, which we call \"mip-NeRF\" (a la \"mipmap\"), extends NeRF to represent the scene at a continuously-valued scale. By efficiently rendering anti-aliased conical frustums instead of rays, mip-NeRF reduces objectionable aliasing artifacts and significantly improves NeRF's ability to represent fine details, while also being 7% faster than NeRF and half the size. Compared to NeRF, mip-NeRF reduces average error rates by 17% on the dataset presented with NeRF and by 60% on a challenging multiscale variant of that dataset that we present. Mip-NeRF is also able to match the accuracy of a brute-force supersampled NeRF on our multiscale dataset while being 22x faster.",

The field saw remarkable progress during the last few years, and existing event-based 3D reconstruction approaches recover sparse point clouds of the scene. However, such sparsity is a limiting factor in many cases, especially in computer vision and graphics, that has not been addressed satisfactorily so far. Accordingly, this paper proposes the first approach for 3D-consistent, dense and photorealistic novel view synthesis using just a single colour event stream as input. At its core is a neural radiance field trained entirely in a self-supervised manner from events while preserving the original resolution of the colour event channels. Next, our ray sampling strategy is tailored to events and allows for data-efficient training. At test, our method produces results in the RGB space at unprecedented quality. We evaluate our method qualitatively and numerically on several challenging synthetic and real scenes and show that it produces significantly denser and more visually appealing renderings than the existing methods. We also demonstrate robustness in challenging scenarios with fast motion and under low lighting conditions. We release the newly recorded dataset and our source code to facilitate the research field, see https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/EventNeRF.",

In this procedure, a model is first trained on counterfeited data synthesised from an out-of-domain dataset, and then fine tuned on a small set of in-domain utterances with a discriminative objective function. Corpus-based evaluation results show that the proposed procedure can achieve competitive performance in terms of BLEU score and slot error rate while significantly reducing the data needed to train generators in new, unseen domains.

A conversion method is considered successful when the produced speech sounds natural and similar to the target speaker. This paper presents a new voice conversion framework in which we combine frequency warping and exemplar-based method for voice conversion. Our method maintains high-resolution details during conversion by directly applying frequency warping on the high-resolution spectrum to represent the target. The warping function is generated by a sparse interpolation from a dictionary of exemplar warping functions. As the generated warping function is dependent only on a very small set of exemplars, we do away with the statistical averaging effects inherited from Gaussian mixture models. To compensate for the conversion error, we also apply residual exemplars into the conversion process. Both objective and subjective evaluations on the VOICES database validated the effectiveness of the proposed voice conversion framework.

We assume we have at our disposal a large amount of speech samples from source and target voice with at least a part of them being parallel. The proposed system is built on a mapping function between source and target spectral envelopes followed by a frame selection algorithm to produce final spectral envelopes. Converted speech is produced by a basic LP analysis of the source and LP synthesis using the converted spectral envelopes. We compared three types of conversion: without mapping, with mapping and using the excitation of the source speaker and finally with mapping using the excitation of the target. Results show that the combination of mapping and frame selection provide the best results, and underline the interest to work on methods to convert the LP excitation.",

        "content1": "Dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a powerful algorithm capable of rendering photo-realistic novel view images from a monocular RGB video of a dynamic scene. Although it warps moving points across frames from the observation spaces to a common canonical space for rendering, dynamic NeRF does not model the change of the reflected color during the warping. As a result, this approach often fails drastically on challenging specular objects in motion. We address this limitation by reformulating the neural radiance field function to be conditioned on surface position and orientation in the observation space. This allows the specular surface at different poses to keep the different reflected colors when mapped to the common canonical space. Additionally, we add the mask of moving objects to guide the deformation field. As the specular surface changes color during motion, the mask mitigates the problem of failure to find temporal correspondences with only RGB supervision. We evaluate our model based on the novel view synthesis quality with a self-collected dataset of different moving specular objects in realistic environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the reconstruction quality of moving specular objects from monocular RGB videos compared to the existing NeRF models. Our code and data are available at the project website https://github.com/JokerYan/NeRF-DS.",
        "content2": "With the advent of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), neural networks can now render novel views of a 3D scene with quality that fools the human eye. Yet, generating these images is very computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a technique based on spatial decomposition capable of mitigating this issue. Our key observation is that there are diminishing returns in employing larger (deeper and/or wider) networks. Hence, we propose to spatially decompose a scene and dedicate smaller networks for each decomposed part. When working together, these networks can render the whole scene. This allows us near-constant inference time regardless of the number of decomposed parts. Moreover, we show that a Voronoi spatial decomposition is preferable for this purpose, as it is provably compatible with the Painter's Algorithm for efficient and GPU-friendly rendering. Our experiments show that for real-world scenes, our method provides up to 3x more efficient inference than NeRF (with the same rendering quality), or an improvement of up to 1.0 dB in PSNR (for the same inference cost).",

        "content1": "Designing task-oriented dialogue systems is a challenging research topic, since it needs not only to generate utterances fulfilling user requests but also to guarantee the comprehensibility. Many previous works trained end-to-end (E2E) models with supervised learning (SL), however, the bias in annotated system utterances remains as a bottleneck. Reinforcement learning (RL) deals with the problem through using non-differentiable evaluation metrics (e.g., the success rate) as rewards. Nonetheless, existing works with RL showed that the comprehensibility of generated system utterances could be corrupted when improving the performance on fulfilling user requests. In our work, we (1) propose modelling the hierarchical structure between dialogue policy and natural language generator (NLG) with the option framework, called HDNO, where the latent dialogue act is applied to avoid designing specific dialogue act representations; (2) train HDNO via hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), as well as suggest the asynchronous updates between dialogue policy and NLG during training to theoretically guarantee their convergence to a local maximizer; and (3) propose using a discriminator modelled with language models as an additional reward to further improve the comprehensibility. We test HDNO on MultiWoz 2.0 and MultiWoz 2.1, the datasets on multi-domain dialogues, in comparison with word-level E2E model trained with RL, LaRL and HDSA, showing improvements on the performance evaluated by automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation. Finally, we demonstrate the semantic meanings of latent dialogue acts to show the explanability for HDNO.",
        "content2": "Natural language generation (NLG) is a critical component of spoken dialogue and it has a significant impact both on usability and perceived quality. Most NLG systems in common use employ rules and heuristics and tend to generate rigid and stylised responses without the natural variation of human language. They are also not easily scaled to systems covering multiple domains and languages. This paper presents a statistical language generator based on a semantically controlled Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) structure. The LSTM generator can learn from unaligned data by jointly optimising sentence planning and surface realisation using a simple cross entropy training criterion, and language variation can be easily achieved by sampling from output candidates. With fewer heuristics, an objective evaluation in two differing test domains showed the proposed method improved performance compared to previous methods. Human judges scored the LSTM system higher on informativeness and naturalness and overall preferred it to the other systems.",

The proposed framework can work with or without parallel training data. With parallel training data, we found that phonetic sub-dictionary outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in objective and subjective evaluations.

The response of knowledge grounded conversation might contain multiple answer entities or no entity at all.

We propose a fully data-driven generative dialogue system GenDS that is capable of generating responses based on input message and related knowledge base (KB). To generate arbitrary number of answer entities even when these entities never appear in the training set, we design a dynamic knowledge enquirer which selects different answer entities at different positions in a single response, according to different local context. It does not rely on the representations of entities, enabling our model deal with out-of-vocabulary entities. We collect a human-human conversation data (ConversMusic) with knowledge annotations. The proposed method is evaluated on CoversMusic and a public question answering dataset.
