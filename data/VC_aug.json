(VC) is a technique for learning mappings among multiple domains without relying on parallel data. This is important but challenging owing to the requirement of learning multiple mappings and the non-availability of explicit supervision. Recently, StarGAN-VC has garnered attention owing to its ability to solve this problem only using a single generator. However, there is still a gap between real and converted speech. To bridge this gap, we rethink conditional methods of StarGAN-VC, which are key components for achieving non-parallel multi-domain VC in a single model, and propose an improved variant called StarGAN-VC2. Particularly, we rethink conditional methods in two aspects: training objectives and network architectures. For the former, we propose a source-and-target conditional adversarial loss that allows all source domain data to be convertible to the target domain data. For the latter, we introduce a modulation-based conditional method that can transform the modulation of the acoustic feature in a domain-specific manner. We evaluated our methods on non-parallel multi-speaker VC. An objective evaluation demonstrates that our proposed methods improve speech quality in terms of both global and local structure measures. Furthermore, a subjective evaluation shows that StarGAN-VC2 outperforms StarGAN-VC in terms of naturalness and speaker similarity.

A WaveNet vocoder conditioned on Mel-spectrograms is built to reconstruct waveforms from the outputs of the SCENT model.

This study focuses on formulating robust techniques for a codebook mapping based voice conversion algorithm. Three different methods are used to improve voice conversion performance: confidence measures, pre-emphasis, and spectral equalization. Analysis is performed for each method and the implementation details are discussed. The first method employs confidence measures in the training stage to eliminate problematic pairs of source and target speech units that might result from possible misalignments, speaking style differences or pronunciation variations. Four confidence measures are developed based on the spectral distance, fundamental frequency (f0) distance, energy distance, and duration distance between the source and target speech units. The second method focuses on the importance of pre-emphasis in line-spectral frequency (LSF) based vocal tract modeling and transformation. The last method, spectral equalization, is aimed at reducing the differences in the source and target long-term spectra when the source and target recording conditions are significantly different. The voice conversion algorithm that employs the proposed techniques is compared with the baseline voice conversion algorithm with objective tests as well as three subjective listening tests. First, similarity to the target voice is evaluated in a subjective listening test and it is shown that the proposed algorithm improves similarity to the target voice by 23.0%.

"This paper presents a new spectral envelope conversion method using deep neural networks (DNNs). The conventional joint density Gaussian mixture model (JDGMM) based spectral conversion methods perform stably and effectively. However, the speech generated by these methods suffer severe quality degradation due to the following two factors: 1) inadequacy of JDGMM in modeling the distribution of spectral features as well as the non-linear mapping relationship between the source and target speakers, 2) spectral detail loss caused by the use of high-level spectral features such as mel-cepstra. Previously, we have proposed to use the mixture of restricted Boltzmann machines (MoRBM) and the mixture of Gaussian bidirectional associative memories (MoGBAM) to cope with these problems. In this paper, we propose to use a DNN to construct a global non-linear mapping relationship between the spectral envelopes of two speakers. The proposed DNN is generatively trained by cascading two RBMs, which model the distributions of spectral envelopes of source and target speakers respectively, using a Bernoulli BAM (BBAM). Therefore, the proposed training method takes the advantage of the strong modeling ability of RBMs in modeling the distribution of spectral envelopes and the superiority of BAMs in deriving the conditional distributions for conversion.

However, body-conducted unvoiced speech is difficult to use in human-to-human speech communication because it sounds unnatural and less intelligible owing to the acoustic change caused by body conduction. To address this issue, voice conversion (VC) methods from NAM to normal speech (NAM-to-Speech) and to a whispered voice (NAM-to-Whisper) are proposed, where the acoustic features of body-conducted unvoiced speech are converted into those of natural voices in a probabilistic manner using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Moreover, these methods are extended to convert not only NAM but also a body-conducted whispered voice (BCW) as another type of body-conducted unvoiced speech.

This is particularly advantageous in that it is suitable for parallel computations using GPUs. It is also beneficial since it enables effective normalization techniques such as batch normalization to be used for all the hidden layers in the networks. Second, it achieves many-to-many conversion by simultaneously learning mappings among multiple speakers using only a single model instead of separately learning mappings between each speaker pair using a different model. This enables the model to fully utilize available training data collected from multiple speakers by capturing common latent features that can be shared across different speakers. Owing to this structure, our model works reasonably well even without source speaker information, thus making it able to handle any-to-many conversion tasks.

A CycleGAN learns forward and inverse mappings simultaneously using adversarial and cycle-consistency losses. This makes it possible to find an optimal pseudo pair from non-parallel data. Furthermore, the adversarial loss can bring the converted speech close to the target one on the basis of indistinguishability without explicit density estimation. This allows to avoid over-smoothing caused by statistical averaging, which occurs in many conventional statistical model-based VC methods that represent data distribution explicitly.

the speaker-specific features using pitch synchronous approach", "content": "The basic goal of the voice conversion system is to modify the speaker-specific characteristics, keeping the message and the environmental information contained in the speech signal intact. Speaker characteristics reflect in speech at different levels, such as, the shape of the glottal pulse (excitation source characteristics), the shape of the vocal tract (vocal tract system characteristics) and the long-term features (suprasegmental or prosodic characteristics). In this paper, we are proposing neural network models for developing mapping functions at each level. The features used for developing the mapping functions are extracted using pitch synchronous analysis. Pitch synchronous analysis provides the estimation of accurate vocal tract parameters, by analyzing the speech signal independently in each pitch period without influenced by the adjacent pitch cycles. In this work, the instants of significant excitation are used as pitch markers to perform the pitch synchronous analysis. The instants of significant excitation correspond to the instants of glottal closure (epochs) in the case of voiced speech, and to some random excitations like onset of burst in the case of nonvoiced speech. Instants of significant excitation are computed from the linear prediction (LP) residual of speech signals by using the property of average group-delay of minimum phase signals. In this paper, line spectral frequencies (LSFs) are used for representing the vocal tract characteristics, and for developing its associated mapping function. LP residual of the speech signal is viewed as excitation source, and the residual samples around the instant of glottal closure are used for mapping. Prosodic parameters at syllable and phrase levels are used for deriving the mapping function. Source and system level mapping functions are derived pitch synchronously, and the incorporation of target prosodic parameters is performed pitch synchronously using instants of significant excitation. The performance of the voice conversion system is evaluated using listening tests. The prediction accuracy of the mapping functions (neural network models) used at different levels in the proposed voice conversion system is further evaluated using objective measures such as deviation (\nD\ni\n)\n, root mean square error (\n\u03bc\nRMSE\n) and correlation coefficient (\n\u03b3\nX\n,\nY\n).

A BNE is obtained from the phoneme recognizer and is utilized to extract speaker-independent, dense and rich spoken content representations from spectral features. Then a multi-speaker location-relative attention based seq2seq synthesis model is trained to reconstruct spectral features from the bottle-neck features, conditioning on speaker representations for speaker identity control in the generated speech. To mitigate the difficulties of using seq2seq models to align long sequences, we down-sample the input spectral feature along the temporal dimension and equip the synthesis model with a discretized mixture of logistic (MoL) attention mechanism. Since the phoneme recognizer is trained with large speech recognition data corpus, the proposed approach can conduct any-to-many voice conversion. Objective and subjective evaluations show that the proposed any-to-many approach has superior voice conversion performance in terms of both naturalness and speaker similarity. Ablation studies are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of feature selection and model design strategies in the proposed approach.

Due to the non-parallel modeling condition, the converted spectra can not be directly optimized, which heavily degrades the performance of a VAE-based VC. In this work, to overcome this problem, we propose to use CycleVAE-based spectral model that indirectly optimizes the conversion flow by recycling the converted features back into the system to obtain corresponding cyclic reconstructed spectra that can be directly optimized.

methods for each group of voice features are outlinedthe spectral features at formants are modelled by using a two-dimensional phoneme-dependent hmmSubband frequency warping is used for spectrum transformation where the subbands are centred on estimates of formant trajectories.the f0 contour extracted from autocorrelation-based pitchmarks is used for modelling the speech pitch and intonation patternsA PSOLA based method is used for transformation of pitch, intonation patterns and speaking rate.finally a method based on deconvolution of the vocal tract is used for the modelling and mapping of the glottal pulseThe experimental results present illustrations of transformations of the various characteristics and perceptual evaluations."}, {"id": "VC_93", "title": "Comparing ANN and GMM in a

Mapping of the intonation patterns (pitch contour) is carried out using a codebook based model at segmental level. The energy profile of the signal is modified using a fixed scaling factor defined between the source and target speakers at the segmental level. Two different methods for residual modification such as residual copying and residual selection methods are used to generate the target residual signal.
