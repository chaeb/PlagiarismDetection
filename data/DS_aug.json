Neural network models have become a recent focus of investigation in dialogue technologies. Previous models required training data to be manually annotated with word meanings and dialogue states, but end-to-end neural network dialogue systems learn to directly output natural-language system responses without needing training data to be manually annotated. Thus, this approach allows us to scale up the size of training data and cover more dialog domains. In addition, dialogue systems require a meta-function to avoid deploying inappropriate responses generated by themselves. To challenge such issues, the DSTC6 consists of three tracks, (1). End-to-End Goal Oriented dialogue Learning to select system responses, (2). End-to-End Conversation Modeling to generate system responses using Natural Language Generation (NLG) and (3). Dialogue Breakdown Detection. Since each domain has different issues to be addressed to develop dialogue systems, we targeted restaurant retrieval dialogues to fill slot-value in Track 1, customer services on Twitter by combining goal-oriented dialogues and ChitChat in Track 2 and human-machine dialogue data for ChitChat in Track 3.\nDSTC6 had 141 people declaring their interests and 23 teams submitted their final results. 18 scientific papers were presented in the wrap-up workshop.

concerns about the fairness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in real-world applications such as computer vision and recommendations. For example, recognition algorithms in computer vision are unfair to black people such as poorly detecting their faces and inappropriately identifying them as \"gorillas\". As one crucial application of AI, dialogue systems have been extensively applied in our society. They are usually built with real human conversational data; thus they could inherit some fairness issues which are held in the real world. However, the fairness of dialogue systems has not been well investigated. In this paper, we perform a pioneering study about the fairness issues in dialogue systems. In particular, we construct a benchmark dataset and propose quantitative measures to understand fairness in dialogue models. Our studies demonstrate that popular dialogue models show significant prejudice towards different genders and races. Besides, to mitigate the bias in dialogue systems, we propose two simple but effective debiasing methods. Experiments show that our methods can reduce the bias in dialogue systems significantly.

tracks aimed to explore the problem of building robust and accurate end-to-end dialog systems. In more detail, DSTC7 focuses on developing and exploring end-to-end technologies for the following three pragmatic challenges: (1) sentence selection for multiple domains, (2) generation of informational responses grounded in external knowledge, and (3) audio visual scene-aware dialog to allow conversations with users about objects and events around them.\nThis paper summarizes the overall setup and results of DSTC7, including detailed descriptions of the different tracks, provided datasets and annotations, overview of the submitted systems and their final results. For Track 1, LSTM-based models performed best across both datasets, allowing teams to effectively handle task variants where no correct answer was present or when multiple paraphrases were included. For Track 2, RNN-based architectures augmented to incorporate facts by using two types of encoders: a dialog encoder and a fact encoder plus using attention mechanisms and a pointer-generator approach provided the best results.

and natural language generator with option framework for task-oriented dialogue system", "content": "Designing task-oriented dialogue systems is a challenging research topic, since it needs not only to generate utterances fulfilling user requests but also to guarantee the comprehensibility. Many previous works trained end-to-end (E2E) models with supervised learning (SL), however, the bias in annotated system utterances remains as a bottleneck. Reinforcement learning (RL) deals with the problem through using non-differentiable evaluation metrics (e.g., the success rate) as rewards. Nonetheless, existing works with RL showed that the comprehensibility of generated system utterances could be corrupted when improving the performance on fulfilling user requests.

bias across different models and datasetsSome researchers resort to human judgment experimentation for assessing response quality, which is expensive, time consuming, and not scalable.Moreover, judges tend to evaluate a small number of dialogues, meaning that minor differences in evaluation configuration may lead to dissimilar results.in this paper we present interpretable metrics for evaluating topic coherence by making use of distributed sentence representationsin addition we introduce calculable approximations of human judgment based on conversational coherence by adopting state-of-the-art entailment techniquesResults show that our metrics can be used as a surrogate for human judgment, making it easy to evaluate dialogue systems on large-scale datasets and allowing an unbiased estimate

In this paper, we present the first large-scale study on persona biases in dialogue systems and conduct analyses on personas of different social classes, sexual orientations, races, and genders.

"Open-domain human-computer conversation has attracted much attention in the field of NLP. Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information.

Modularized systems rely on DST to interact with the KB, which is expensive in terms of annotation and inference time. End-to-end systems use the KB directly as input, but they cannot scale when the KB is larger than a few hundred entries. In this paper, we propose a method to embed the KB, of any size, directly into the model parameters. The resulting model does not require any DST or template responses, nor the KB as input, and it can dynamically update its KB via fine-tuning. We evaluate our solution in five task-oriented dialogue datasets with small, medium, and large KB size. Our experiments show that end-to-end models can effectively embed knowledge bases in their parameters and achieve competitive performance in all evaluated datasets."}, {"id": "DS_98_SR", "title":
